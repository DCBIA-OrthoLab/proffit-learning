<p>We will define it as extensive treatment that involves multiple dental specialties in addition to orthodontics. These patients are likely to require endodontics, periodontics, oral/maxillofacial surgery, implants, and restorations of all types.</p>
<p>As an example, consider James’s problems.</p>
<p>He says, “I know it’s time to get my teeth fixed up.” He has lost multiple teeth, severe wear on lower incisors, evidence of active periodontal disease, and several teeth requiring restorations.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="235" resourceHeight="328" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/03a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="57" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/03a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, face</label><caption><p>James, age 27, prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="348" resourceHeight="271" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/03b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="103" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/03b_s.jpg"><label>Image 2, maxillary occlusal</label><caption><p>James, age 27, prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="339" resourceHeight="225" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/03c.jpg" thumbnailWidth="121" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/03c_s.jpg"><label>Image 3, mandibular occlusal</label><caption><p>James, age 27, prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Sequence of Treatment (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Note the severity of the Class II malocclusion, with excessive overjet and

(image 5) that the malocclusion is due to a combination of maxillary dental

tipped and well forward from the anterior extent of their supporting bone.</p>

<p>Also note how far the chin is behind a true vertical line dropped from 
nasion. The maxilla (point A) is slightly behind this line, the mandible 
(points B and pogonion) are well behind it. The skeletal Class II,

treatment?</p>

<p>The principle is simple, though the application may not be.</p>

<p>First, active disease must be brought under control (image 1). This would 
involve extraction of hopeless teeth, periodontics at the level needed to 
control active disease, endodontics as needed to maintain important teeth, 
and restorations (perhaps temporary ones) for caries control. For James, 
the first step consisted entirely of perio control.</p>

<p>Second, correct the alignment and occlusion of the teeth and do what is 
necessary to obtain acceptable dental esthetics and facial proportions.</p>

<p>Keep in mind why James wants his teeth fixed: For better health and function, 
but especially to improve his chances of getting ahead in the world—which 
means that his post-treatment facial appearance is important.</p>

<p>This second stage involves orthodontics and, if needed, orthognathic surgery 
(image 2). For James, mandibular advancement surgery was needed to put him in 
a position where satisfactory replacement of missing teeth was feasible. It 
also removed the “weak chin” appearance. In this image, you can 
see the screws in the mandibular ramus to hold the segments while healing 
occurs after mandibular advancement.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="281" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/06.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="78" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/06_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, disease control</label><caption><p>First step: disease control.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="328" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/07.jpg" thumbnailWidth="58" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/07_s.jpg"><label>Image 2, dentofacial correction</label><caption><p>Second step: correct facial proportions and dental occlusion.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Sequence of Treatment (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Third, provide definitive periodontics (anything needed for long-term 
maintenance, for example, bone or soft tissue grafts) and definitive 
restorative dentistry. That could mean implants, onlays, crowns, fixed or 
removable partial dentures. Typically, it would include replacement of 
temporary restorations that were placed for disease control until the 
occlusion could be corrected.</p>

<p>At that point, the benefit of the orthodontic component of treatment for 
restoration of missing teeth becomes apparent. Because crowns/bridge abutments 
etc. can be fabricated more ideally, the restorative dentistry has a better 
long-term prognosis.</p>

<p>For James, the last step in treatment was extensive posterior restorations 
including bridges on the right side, which you can see in this cephalometric 
radiograph at the completion of treatment (image 1).</p>

<p>The facial change created by putting the mandible in its proper position can 
be seen in image 2. Would you agree that the stronger chin makes him look 
more confident and more competent? The pretreatment person would be easier 
to push around?</p>

<p>Because the dental relationships were normal after the mandibular advancement 
and orthodontic finishing, no compromises in the restorations were necessary 
(images 3-5). An implant-supported partial denture on the right side was 
deferred because of cost—premolar occlusion on that side was acceptable. 
It should be possible now for him to maintain dental health.</p>

<p>As often is the case, the treatment changed his own view of what he could 
accomplish. He quit his job in a service industry after taking classes in 
computer programming while the treatment was being carried out and embarked 
on a new career.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="343" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/08.jpg" thumbnailWidth="61" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/08_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, finish ceph</label><caption><p>Cephalometric radiograph at completion of treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="431" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/09.jpg" thumbnailWidth="111" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/09_s.jpg"><label>Image 2, facial change</label><caption><p>Change in facial appearance.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="351" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/10.jpg" thumbnailWidth="62" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/10_s.jpg"><label>Image 3, right lateral</label><caption><p>Change in dental occlusion.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="366" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/11.jpg" thumbnailWidth="65" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/11_s.jpg"><label>Image 4, frontal intra-oral</label><caption><p>Change in dental occlusion.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="353" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/12.jpg" thumbnailWidth="63" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/12_s.jpg"><label>Image 5, left lateral</label><caption><p>Change in dental occlusion.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Sequence of Treatment (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Some special points about the sequencing of complex treatment.</p>

<p>(1) Teeth that have had endodontic treatment can be moved orthodontically. 
Their periodontal ligament remains normal, and the response to orthodontic 
force is similar. Some reports have indicated a greater risk of root 
resorption with tooth movement after endodontics, others have found no 
difference or even less root resorption. The best evidence is that root 
resorption is not a major concern when endo-treated teeth are moved.</p>

<p>But orthodontic movement may be the last straw for a tooth with a 
traumatized or sensitized pulp. A patient with a tooth that may need 
endo treatment must be warned that it is possible for it to flare up and 
require treatment when orthodontics begins.</p>

<p>For this patient (images 1-5), in order to align severely crowded incisor 
teeth, the lower left first premolar was extracted. Despite the periapical 
area that required apicoectomy, the first molar was retained, and it 
responded normally to orthodontic tooth movement after the endodontic 
re-treatment.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="366" resourceHeight="258" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/13a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="113" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/13a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, pre-treatment crowding</label><caption><p>Mandibular arch prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="330" resourceHeight="258" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/13b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="102" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/13b_s.jpg"><label>Image 2, pre-treatment periapical area</label><caption><p>Periapical area lower left first molar prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="366" resourceHeight="258" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/13c.jpg" thumbnailWidth="113" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/13c_s.jpg"><label>Image 3, orthodontic progress</label><caption><p>Orthodontic progress, premolar extraction space closed.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="330" resourceHeight="269" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/13d.jpg" thumbnailWidth="98" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/13d_s.jpg"><label>Image 4, post-treatment periapical area</label><caption><p>Orthodontic treatment in progress after apicoectomy.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="530" resourceHeight="400" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/13.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/13_s.jpg"><label>Image 5, comparison</label><caption><p>Comparison before/after space closure involving endo-treated molar.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Sequence of Treatment (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Some special points about the sequencing of complex treatment.</p>

<p>(2) Temporary restorations to control caries or replace unsatisfactory ones 
often are needed prior to orthodontics or surgery to correct the occlusion, 
but the temporary restoration must last for the duration of the orthodontic 
treatment, i.e., up to two years.</p>

<p>Susan, who was a candidate for orthognathic surgery, had poor crowns on her 
previously fractured maxillary central incisors (image 1). These had to be 
replaced in the first stage of treatment (disease control) to control the 
gingival inflammation (image 2). Temporary acrylic crowns were used during 
the duration of the orthodontic treatment (image 3), then new porcelain 
crowns were placed soon after the orthodontic appliance was removed 
(images 4, 5).</p>

<p>Crowns on incisors in patients with excessive overjet often are made thick 
faciolingually in order to obtain occlusal contact of the incisors. The thick 
crowns make it impossible to correct the overjet during orthodontic 
treatment, so even a well-fitting crown on an upper incisor may have to be 
removed if it is too thick. Sometimes an old crown can be retained during 
treatment after it has been extensively reshaped, and then replaced after the 
occlusion has been corrected.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="360" resourceHeight="252" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/14a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="114" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/14a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, pre-tx crowns</label><caption><p>Prior to treatment, unsatisfactory crowns on central incisors.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="324" resourceHeight="243" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/14b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/14b_s.jpg"><label>Image 2, temporary crowns</label><caption><p>Temporary crowns in place, just prior to orthognathic surgery.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="348" resourceHeight="232" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/14c.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/14c_s.jpg"><label>Image 3, during tx</label><caption><p>Temporary crowns, after orthognathic surgery, during finishing orthodontics.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="336" resourceHeight="234" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/14d.jpg" thumbnailWidth="115" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/14d_s.jpg"><label>Image 4, permanent crowns</label><caption><p>Permanent crowns, placed soon after completion of orthodontics.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/14.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/14_s.jpg"><label>Image 5, tx sequence</label><caption><p>Overview of treatment sequence.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Sequence of Treatment (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Some special points about the sequencing of complex treatment.</p>

<p>(3) It is critically important for patients with complex problems to be seen 
regularly for perio maintenance during active orthodontics. The recall 
schedule is established from the patient’s needs, but often 
scaling/curettage is needed at 2-3-month intervals.</p>

<p>For this patient, extraction of periodontally involved incisors with a 
poor long-term prognosis (image 1) made it possible to align the severely 
crowded anterior teeth in both arches (images 2, 3) and improve the chances 
of maintaining the remaining teeth. Continued perio recall at 3-month 
intervals during the orthodontic treatment was an important part of 
patient management.</p>

<p>Periodontal problems must be brought under control before orthodontic 
treatment begins and must be kept under control during the orthodontics.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="342" resourceHeight="187" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/15a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="146" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/15a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, pre-tx</label><caption><p>Prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="360" resourceHeight="196" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/15b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="147" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/15b_s.jpg"><label>Image 2, extractions</label><caption><p>Incisor extractions, perio treatment continuing.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="342" resourceHeight="188" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/15c.jpg" thumbnailWidth="146" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/15c_s.jpg"><label>Image 3, progress</label><caption><p>Alignment progress, frequent perio recalls scheduled.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Sequence of Treatment (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Some special points about the sequencing of complex treatment.</p>

<p>(4) Careful coordination between the end of orthodontic treatment and the 
final restorative work is important. The time in orthodontic retainers 
before restorations are placed should be minimal. Waiting to start the 
restorative dentistry “until things settle down” is a recipe 
for problems.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: Bridges/implants serve as permanent retainers after 
the orthodontics. The removable retainers typically used after orthodontics 
in adolescents rarely are satisfactory even for short times in adults 
awaiting fixed prosthodontics. Bonded or thermoplastic (suckdown) retainers 
are better, but not as good as fixed prostheses.</p>

<p>Bottom line: When the braces come off, get on with the restorative work 
sooner rather than later. For James, the patient whom we just looked at, 
the bridges are permanent retainers.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="312" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/16.jpg" thumbnailWidth="55" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/16_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>James, age 29, bridges serving also as permanent retainers.</p></caption></resource></resources></page></pages></section><section><title>Case #1: Implants or Bridges?</title><pages><page pageType="content"><title>Case #1: Implants vs Bridges</title><pageText><p>Now let’s look at a patient who illustrates important considerations 
in answering two common clinical questions:</p>

<ol><li> close old extraction spaces, or open them for prosthetic replacements?</li>
<li> implants or bridges to replace missing teeth?</li>
</ol><p>June (images 1-5) was age 45 when she sought treatment. She was concerned about 
the appearance of her teeth and wanted her missing molars replaced. Her 
comment: “I paid for orthodontics for two kids and just finished putting 
both of them through college. Now it’s my turn.”</p>

<p>As she put it, she “smiled a crooked smile” because the maxillary 
left lateral incisor was congenitally missing. Composite had been added to the 
mesial of the canine to partially conceal the missing tooth, but the asymmetry 
was obvious when she smiled.</p>

<p>All four first molars were missing. In the maxillary arch the extraction space 
was closed on the right side, partially open on the left. Both lower second 
molars were severely tipped mesially, and the left second molar was also 
displaced buccally. There was a significant buccal crossbite on the left.</p>

<p>There were restorations in most posterior teeth, with recent composites placed 
for caries control in mandibular second premolars.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="400" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/17.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/17_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, facial appearance</label><caption><p>June, age 45, prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="402" resourceHeight="192" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/18a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="79" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/18a_s.jpg"><label>Image 2, frontal intraoral</label><caption><p>June, age 45, prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="354" resourceHeight="186" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/18b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="152" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/18b_s.jpg"><label>Image 3, right lateral</label><caption><p>June, age 45, prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="342" resourceHeight="192" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/18c.jpg" thumbnailWidth="143" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/18c_s.jpg"><label>Image 4, left lateral</label><caption><p>June, age 45, prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="318" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/19.jpg" thumbnailWidth="57" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/19_s.jpg"><label>Image 5, occlusal views</label><caption><p>June, age 45, prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Case #1: Initial Records</title><pageText><p>When these initial orthodontic records were taken, she had already undergone

<ul><li>how to manage the esthetic problem created by the missing maxillary 
lateral incisor</li>
<li>how to manage the maxillary first molar extraction sites, one of 
which was already closed</li>
<li>how to manage the mandibular first molar extraction sites, with

<li>how to replace missing teeth if spaces were opened (bridges or implants?)</li>
</ul></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="290" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/20.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/20_s.jpg"><label>Pre-tx pan</label><caption><p>June, age 45, prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Case #1: Treatment Plan</title><pageText><p>For incisor esthetics, symmetry is always important. This was a major factor 
in planning treatment for June. It would be very difficult to restore 
the maxillary left canine to make it an acceptable substitute for the 
missing lateral incisor, especially because its gingival margin was so 
different from the natural lateral on the other side. Opening space for 
replacement for the lateral incisor was feasible because space for the 
missing first molar in the same quadrant could be closed as this was done.</p>

<p>Her occlusion also was a factor: She was almost in anterior crossbite, and 
slightly advancing the maxillary incisors would improve the incisor 
relationships in function.</p>

<p>Thus the plan for the maxillary arch was to:</p>

<ul><li>open space for a prosthetic lateral incisor, and</li>
<li>close the first molar extraction sites.</li>
</ul><p>An important factor in the decision: Recent research has shown that unlike the 
lower arch, good periodontal health is possible with upper second molars 
tipped mesially, so there was no compelling reason to try to bring the roots 
of the upper second molars mesially.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="290" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/21.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/21_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>Maxillary arch, treatment plan.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Case #1, Treatment Plan (cont.)</title><pageText><p>In the mandibular arch, closing the old first molar extraction sites would 
be extremely difficult and time consuming. To do that, it would be necessary 
to place implants in the mandibular ramus to serve as anchorage to bring 
the second and third molar roots mesially. As these molars were moved 
mesially, they also would have to be moved even further lingually to correct 
the crossbite.</p>

<p>In contrast, if the mandibular third molars were extracted, tipping the 
second molars upright would be straightforward and would have the added 
advantage of improving periodontal health on the mesial of these teeth. 
Mesially tipped lower molars are at risk periodontally.</p>

<p>The question of implants versus bridges for the three replacement teeth that 
would be needed was left open at the time the orthodontics was begun.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="290" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/22.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/22_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>June, age 45, treatment plan.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Case #1, Treatment Plan (cont.)</title><pageText><p>For severely tipped lower molars, an auxiliary uprighting spring (images 1, 2) 
often is the most effective way to begin the necessary tooth movement. 
For June, the uprighting spring could be contoured to tip the lower right 
second molar lingually as it uprighted. Often lingual tipping is an undesirable 
side effect of uprighting springs—for her it was an advantage.</p>

<p>After 10 months of treatment, the lower molars had been uprighted (images 3, 4).
The maxillary lateral incisor space had been opened, and a prosthetic lateral 
incisor was attached to the arch wire. This creates a highly esthetic 
replacement, but it needs to be attached to a rigid rectangular wire for 
stability.</p>

<p>Note the use of bonded attachments on the molars as well as the other teeth. 
If possible, bands should be avoided in patients with previous perio problems 
around molar teeth. In June’s case, curettage on the mesial of the 
second molars as they uprighted was an important part of the treatment.</p>

<p>At 14 months the maxillary space had been closed, but (as planned) the upper 
molars still were tipped mesially. As we have noted, mesially tipped upper 
molars are much more compatible with good periodontal health than mesially 
tipped lower molars. At that point uprighting of the lower molars had nearly 
been completed.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="444" resourceHeight="268" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/23a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="133" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/23a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, uprighting diagram</label><caption><p>Diagrammatic representation, uprighting a severely tipped lower

to implants versus bridges had to be made. The greater cost of implants 
was a factor, but June wanted the best quality of result and would consider 
implants.</p>

<p>For her, a single tooth implant to replace the maxillary lateral incisor 
offered better esthetics than a bridge and would not require crowns on the 
central incisor and canine (image 1).</p>

<p>In the lower arch, however (image 2), implant placement was complicated by 
the loss of bone at the old extraction sites, especially on the left side. 
Bone grafting would be needed before an implant could be placed there. The 
lower second molars and the right second premolar needed permanent 
restorations and would benefit from crowns.</p>

<p>The decision, therefore, was an implant in the maxillary incisor region 
and bridges in the lower arch.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="354" resourceHeight="243" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/27a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="117" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/27a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, maxillary occlusal</label><caption><p>18 months progress, treatment nearly completed.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="354" resourceHeight="253" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/27b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="112" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/27b_s.jpg"><label>Image 2, mandibular occlusal</label><caption><p>18 months progress, treatment nearly completed.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Case #1: Sequencing of Implant Placement with Final Orthodontics</title><pageText><p>The interaction between completion of orthodontics and implant placement is 
an important consideration. Note (images 1-3) that at 24 months after 
the beginning of treatment, an implant had been placed in June’s 
maxillary arch. The orthodontic appliance had been removed in the mandibular 
arch, and bonded wire retainers were in place, but the maxillary orthodontic 
appliance remains in place—why?</p>

<p>The reason is that the orthodontic appliance is an effective way to supply 
a pontic for the esthetically sensitive maxillary incisor area while 
healing around the implant site occurs. The pontic tied to the arch wire 
avoids any contact with the soft tissue over the implant. This could be a 
problem if a removable retainer with a replacement tooth were used.</p>

<p>Note the bonded retainers in the lower arch to maintain the incisor alignment 
and control the molar spaces. Fixed, not removable, retainers are preferred 
in complex treatment. Fabrication of the lower bridges could have started at 
this point but were delayed until the implant crown was completed.</p>

<p>With the orthodontic appliance still supplying the temporary pontic 
(images 4, 5), a connective tissue graft was placed on the facial of the 
lateral implant area, and a healing abutment was attached.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="319" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/28.jpg" thumbnailWidth="150" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/28_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, 24 months pan</label><caption><p>June, age 47, 24 months progress, maxillary implant, mandibular

<p>Note that the anterior deep bite has not been corrected prior to surgery. 
Instead, the mandible will be rotated so that the chin moves downward and 
forward, increasing anterior face height. This is an important part of the 
surgical change, which corrects not only the anteroposterior mandibular 
deficiency but also the short face height.</p>

<p>Note also the uprighting of the mandibular left second molar after 
extraction of the third molar. The coil spring used for distalization 
after uprighting is still in place, but it must be passive at this point. 
Further tooth movement can be accomplished postsurgically if needed.

proper vertical incisor relationships are established.</p>

<p>Cephalometric superimposition on the cranial base for the presurgical phase 
of treatment (image 4, right) shows that some downward-backward rotation of

accomplished at surgery, along with advancement of the chin. This increases 
face height and allows correction of the anterior deep bite.</p>

he returned for completion of the orthodontic treatment. Despite the beard 
that he started regrowing immediately after surgery, the improvement in 
facial proportions is obvious. Often in mandibular deficient patients, 
increasing face height is as important as bringing the chin forward.</p>

<p>At that point, both the plastic splint that was maintained interocclusally 
after surgery and the stabilizing arch wires were removed. Downward rotation 
of the mandible as it was advanced had corrected the anterior deep bite 
(images 2-3). Lighter working arch wires were placed, and Jim wore light 
elastics as he accommodated to the new mandibular position (note the elastic 
hooks formed from modified ligatures on canine brackets). After patients 
have undergone jaw surgery, they are highly motivated to obtain an 
excellent result, so cooperation with elastics and other aspects of 
treatment rarely is a problem.</p>

<p>In the panoramic radiograph at 6 weeks postsurgery (image 4), the titanium 
screws used to hold the mandibular segments during healing can be seen. 
Although these can be removed, usually they are not, because unless they 
cause a problem, which is quite unusual, there is no reason to put the 
patient through additional surgery to remove them.</p>

<p>Cephalometrically, the improvement in mandibular position is apparent 
(image 5). The cephalometric superimposition pre- to postsurgery 
shows the extent to which both face height and chin prominence were 
increased by rotating the mandible downward as it was brought forward.

the orthodontic appliance was removed. Since the maxillary incisor 
pontics were tied to the arch wire, replacement teeth were needed 
immediately (image 1). Correction of the deep overbite has made 
prosthetic replacement of the missing teeth much easier.</p>

<p>A temporary maxillary fixed bridge was placed as soon as the orthodontic 
appliance was removed (images 2-4). It served as a fixed retainer for 
the maxillary teeth. No other maxillary retainer was needed.</p>

<p>In the mandibular arch (image 5, top), a removable retainer was needed 
initially to maintain both the pontic space on the right side and the 
vertical space for lower replacement teeth on the left. The retainer 
was thick enough in the mandibular left posterior area to provide 
occlusal contact with the upper molars, to control any tendency for the 
upper teeth to elongate.</p>

<p>A temporary mandibular fixed bridge was placed in the mandibular right 
quadrant within the next month, and the removable lower retainer was 
modified to accommodate its presence (image 5, bottom). The removable 
retainer still was needed to prevent further eruption of the upper 
left teeth until a partial denture could be supplied.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="382" resourceHeight="248" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/51a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="123" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/51a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, post-treatment frontal</label><caption><p>Completion of orthodontics, temporary pontics removed.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="344" resourceHeight="240" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/51b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="115" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/51b_s.jpg"><label>Image 2, temporary bridge, occlusal</label><caption><p>Temporary maxillary fixed bridge, placed immediately after removal of the

was removed (image 1) shows the crown/bridge preparations in both 
arches. Although the endodontically treated lower premolars were 
repositioned orthodontically, further endo treatment was not 
necessary—but the patient was prepared for that possibility.</p>

<p>The definitive prosthodontics, with fixed prostheses in the maxillary 
anterior and mandibular right posterior, and a mandibular removable 
partial denture to replace the missing teeth on the lower left 
(images 2, 3), was completed within the next 9 months. Jim was very pleased 
with the improved appearance on smile (image 4).</p>

<p>An alternative plan, of course, would have been placement of an implant 
in the mandibular left posterior region to serve as a posterior abutment 
for a fixed bridge. The additional cost and time of doing that, which 
would have required a bone graft before the implant could be placed, 
made the removable partial a better choice for this patient. Temporary 
bridges are satisfactory orthodontic retainers, so if these are used, 
there is less urgency to place the permanent restorations, but it is 
desirable to complete the prosthodontic phase of treatment as soon as 
possible after the orthodontics is completed.</p>

<p>The end-of-treatment panoramic radiograph (image 5) shows the final fixed 
prostheses in place, with good periodontal health at this point. The 
occlusion was stable during the fabrication of the prostheses.</p>

<p>For Jim, as for other patients with similarly complex problems, careful 
integration of the various phases of treatment was a key to success.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="412" resourceHeight="224" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/53.jpg" thumbnailWidth="147" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/53_s.jpg"><label>Image 1, prosthetic progress pan</label><caption><p>Panoramic radiograph 3 months after removal of orthodontic appliances.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="385" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/54.jpg" thumbnailWidth="68" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/54_s.jpg"><label>Image 2, lateral view, restorations</label><caption><p>Completed restorations 9 months after completion of orthodontics, lateral views.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="304" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/55.jpg" thumbnailWidth="54" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/55_s.jpg"><label>Image 3, occlusal view, restorations</label><caption><p>Completed restorations, occlusal views.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/56.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/56_s.jpg"><label>Image 4, frontal view</label><caption><p>Dental and facial esthetics, frontal views.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="407" resourceHeight="201" resourceLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/57.jpg" thumbnailWidth="162" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="complexadjuncttx/images/57_s.jpg"><label>Image 5, prosthetic completion pan</label><caption><p>Panoramic radiograph after completion of restorations.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Summary and Conclusions</title><pageText><p>In summary:</p>

<ul class="spaced"><li>Complex adjunctive orthodontic treatment requires a team of dentists 
for treatment because it requires orthodontics, periodontics, restorative 
dentistry and often other dental specialties (endodontics, prosthodontics, 
oral-maxillofacial surgery). A major goal of the orthodontic treatment 
is to facilitate treatment of the patient’s other needs.</li>
<li>Sequence of treatment is important: 
  <ul><li>First, disease control 
      <ul><li>periodontics</li>
        <li>endodontics</li>
        <li>extractions</li>
        <li>temporary restorations</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>Second, correction of the alignment/occlusion
      <ul><li>orthodontics</li>
        <li>orthognathic surgery</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>Third, definitive perio/restorative/prosthodontics</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>Important special considerations in complex adjunctive treatment: 
  <ul><li> Tooth movement can be the last straw for a tooth on the borderline 
    for requiring endo treatment; fortunately, endo-treated teeth 
    can be moved orthodontically</li>
    <li> Temporary restorations will have to last for the duration of 
    orthodontic treatment, so should be good for 2 years</li>
    <li> Perio maintenance during orthodontics often means frequent 
    perio recall</li>
    <li> Coordination between the end of orthodontics and the final 
    restorative/prosthodontic treatment is important—there should 
    be minimal delay between the completion of orthodontics and the 
    final restorations</li>
