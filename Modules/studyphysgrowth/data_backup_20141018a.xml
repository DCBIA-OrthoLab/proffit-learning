As with this and all the computer teaching programs, it's important to read the assigned material in Contemporary Orthodontics (5th edition, pages 33-40; 4th ed., 40-47;) as well as view the program.</p>
<p>Then you will take the self-test, the last section of the teaching module, and use it to consolidate the information and to be sure that you really understand it. Remember, the test is a teaching tool. Its purpose isn’t to evaluate you and provide some sort of grade—that doesn’t happen. Its purpose is to help you master the material.</p></pageText><resources/></page><page pageType="content"><title>Learning Objectives</title><pageText><p>In this first computer teaching module, we will distinguish the somewhat overlapping terms of “growth” and “development” from each other, and provide an overview of methods used to study growth.</p>
<p>The general learning objectives of this module are to:</p>
<ul><li>Distinguish the somewhat overlapping terms of “growth” and “development” from each other</li>
<li>Discuss the concepts of pattern, variability, and timing as they are applied to the study of growth and development</li>
<li>Provide an overview of the methods for studying growth from which our current knowledge was derived</li>
</ul></pageText><resources/></page><page pageType="content"><title>Growth</title><pageText><p>If you are not careful, the very word “growth” can cause some 
difficulties.</p>

<p>Growth certainly refers to an increase in size, but it’s more that that. 
More than anything else, growth indicates change—which is why it’s 
possible sometimes to speak of negative growth.</p>

<p>Development indicates new capabilities, often bigger and better, perhaps at some 
cost. In this course on growth an development, it’s important to distinguish 
these terms.</p>

<p>For our use:</p>

<p>Growth, most of the time, will refer to a change, almost always an increase, in 
size or number, generally with an anatomic reference. Occasionally, however, it will be 
used to indicate more of an increase in complexity than size.</p>

<p>Development will be used primarily to refer to an increase in complexity—especially 
when this carries with it an overtone of specialization and loss of potential.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="262" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/01_04.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="73" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/01_04_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption/></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s01_p03_02.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s01_p03_02s.jpg"><label>Image 2</label><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Growth / Development: Why?</title><pageText><p>As a dental student, why should you study growth and development?</p>

<p>There are two important reasons:</p>

<ul><li>You have to understand normal dental, facial and psychosocial growth 
and development to work with children. You can't distinguish the abnormal 
from the normal if you don't understand the normal pattern of development.</li>
<li>The dentist can manipulate growth to some extent, and it is important 
to do so in treating developmental problems in children. For example, 
headgear devices, like the ones shown here often are used to treat 
problems like protruding upper teeth and the deficient lower jaw that 
often is a major part of the problem.</li>
</ul></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="382" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/01_06.jpg" thumbnailWidth="126" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/01_06_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page></pages></section><section><title>Concepts of Pattern, Variability and Timing</title><pages><page pageType="content"><title>Growth Pattern</title><pageText><p>Let's start with the important concept of growth pattern. Think about the 
pattern for an article of clothing. As the pattern increases in size, there are 
changes in some areas that are larger or smaller than changes in other 
areas—it isn't just blown up like a balloon. In this way, the pattern 
reflects a complex set of proportional relationships.</p>

<p>Pattern in growth is a higher level pattern, a step beyond the pattern that 
gets clothes to fit or describes body proportions at any one time. It refers to 
the predictable changes in body proportions over time as the individual grows.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p01_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p01_01s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Growth Pattern: Proportion Changes</title><pageText><p>There are striking changes in body proportions over time.</p>

<p>Note that at the end of the second month in utero, the head and face comprise almost 
50% of the total body length. In contrast, the limbs are still rudimentary and the trunk 
underdeveloped. It may seem strange that at one time your nose was as big as your hand, but 
that was the case in early life.</p>

<p>The proportion of total body size contributed by the head and face steadily decreases 
after the 3rd month of fetal lfe. By the time of birth, greater growth of the truck and 
limbs has reduced the head to 25% of the entire body. This pattern continues, so that the 
head and face contribute proportionally less and less to the total body length. This relative 
reduction in head and face size is because the craniofacial structures developed earlier. In 
later growth, structures away from the head grow more to catch up. This is called the 
cephalocaudal gradient of growth, and it's an important part of the growth pattern that 
you need to always keep in mind.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="357" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/02_03.jpg" thumbnailWidth="134" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/02_03_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Growth Pattern: Cephalocaudal Gradient</title><pageText><p>Even within the head and face, the cephalocaudal gradient of growth leads to changes 
in proportionality during growth. When the skull of a newborn is compared to that of an 
adult, it is easy to see that postnatally there's relatively more growth of the face than 
the cranium. This reflects the early growth of the nervous system. The cranium, the part 
of the head that serves as a housing for the brain, must grow rapidly early on, and grows 
less later.</p>

<p>Within the face, structures closer to the brain grow more earlier and less later. Thus 
the mandible is less developed at an early point than the maxilla and grows more postnatally.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="593" resourceHeight="284" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/02_04.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/02_04_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Variability</title><pageText><p>Now let's turn to the concept of variability. Obviously, everyone is not alike in the 
way they grow. In dealing with a child, you'll need to know if the size (growth) or development 
stage (complexity) is normal. How would you determine that?</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p04_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p04_01s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Variability: Sample Size Effect</title><pageText><p>Normal variation leads to the well-known bell-shaped curve in the distribution of individuals within a group, so that most individuals cluster near a midpoint and few are found at the extremes. The bigger the group, the more obvious the clustering near the mean. Notice what happens when heights are plotted for these two groups.</p>
<p>An important concept: if you don't see the bell-shaped curve with clustering around a mid-point, you're not looking at a normal distribution. And then statistics based on the normal distribution no longer are appropriate.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p05_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p05_01s.jpg"><label>Image 1, Distribution #1</label><caption><p>This distribution and distribution 2 both are relatively normal, despite very different numbers of observations in each sample.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p05_02.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p05_02s.jpg"><label>Image 2, Distribution #2</label><caption><p>This distribution and distribution 1 both are relatively normal, despite very different numbers of observations in each sample.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Variability: Distribution Measures</title><pageText><p>There are several ways to express the distribution of values within a group:</p>
<ul><li>The <b>range</b> is from the smallest to the largest value.</li>
<li>The <b>mean</b> is the arithmetic average.</li>
<li>The <b>standard deviation </b>is calculated from a mathematical formula is a way to describe the variability.</li>
</ul><p>One standard deviation (S.D.) encompasses 67% of the people in a normal distribution, two S.D. includes 95% and three S.D. includes 99%. A larger standard deviation implies greater variability—but the number of individuals in the group can affect the values. With only a few individuals, each one heavily influences the values, and the standard deviation for a small group is likely to be large. Larger samples give more reliable data for mean and S.D.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p06_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p06_01s.jpg"><label>Image 1, Distribution #1</label><caption><p>The mean and standard deviation are most commonly reported to describe the central tendency and variation of a normal sample.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p06_02.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p06_02s.jpg"><label>Image 2, Distribution #2</label><caption><p>The mean and standard deviation are most commonly reported to describe the central tendency and variation of a normal sample.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Mean / Std. Deviation vs. Median / Percentiles</title><pageText><p>Another way to describe the central tendency of a group is to use the median, or middle person in each distribution.  The median value corresponds to the 2nd quartile (Q2), and the inter-quartile range (IQR) is the measure of variation reported with the median value - just as standard deviation is reported with the mean. Usually the median is less sensitive to one or two individuals at the extremes. Often it is a better descriptor of small samples. </p>
<p>Percentiles also can be used to note where an individual stands relative to his or her peers.</p>
<p>The middle of a distribution is the 50th percentile. At the 25th percentile, 75% of the group are taller than that individual. At the 90th percentile, only 10% would be taller.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p07_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p07_01s.jpg"><label>Image 1, Distribution #1</label><caption><p>The median and IQR (inter-quartile range) are most commonly reported to describe the central tendency and variation of a non-normal sample.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p07_02.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p07_02s.jpg"><label>Image 2, Distribution #2</label><caption><p>The median and IQR (inter-quartile range) are most commonly reported to describe the central tendency and variation of a non-normal sample.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Growth Charts</title><pageText><p>Growth charts, expressed in percentiles, often are used to show how a patient compares to his or her peers in height and weigh, and how that changes over time. The lines indicate the percentiles, the x axis is time and the y axis indicates height or weight. The charts for boys and girls are different (although the differences are surprisingly small prior to adolescence).</p>
<p>For this normal girl, height and weight values plot consistently near the 50th percentile, but normal variation is relatively large. As a general guideline, a child who is between the 3rd and 97th percentiles is considered within the normal range. Outside that, abnormality must be suspected.</p>
<p>To view this chart more clearly (it's hard to make it large enough on the computer screen), look at Figure 2-4 in <i>​Contemporary Orthodontics</i>​ (4th or 5th ed.).</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="321" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/growthchart1.jpg" thumbnailWidth="57" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/growthchart1_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Growth Charts (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Normal growth is shown on a growth chart not so much by being at the 50th percentile, as by maintaining about the same percentile over time. A child who plots at the 20th percentile consistently is just a small but normal child.</p>
<p>Crossing the percentiles, particularly crossing several of them, usually indicates abnormal growth and some problem. In this respect, height is a more sensitive indicator than weight.</p>
<p>Here we see the plot for a boy who developed a medical problem that affected growth at age 10, with partial recovery at age 13, but a long-term growth deficit.

<p>You could check your patient's face height, and its change over time, against a standard graph of this type. Note that there's a different value for boys and girls, and the male-female difference gets larger as the children get older.</p>
<p>This is largely due to variations in timing,which is the next concept to be discussed.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="327" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/mgs188.jpg" thumbnailWidth="58" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/mgs188_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Timing: Description</title><pageText><p>Boys and girls get bigger over time, of course, but differences between individuals of the 
same age and gender, and differences between the sexes, are most notable near adolescence. 
That is because sexual maturation leads to an adolescent growth spurt. This happens at a 
different time in girls and boys and happens at different times in individuals of the same 
gender. On the average, girls have their adolescent growth spurt 2 years ahead of boys. That 
doesn't mean that all girls mature faster than all boys--there's too much individual variation 
for that to be true.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p11_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p11_01s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Timing: Description (cont.)</title><pageText><p>This diagram plots the increase in height each year for three girls, who experienced 
a growth spurt at different times because of a difference in timing of sexual maturation. 
M-1, M-2 and M-3 show for each girl the age (age range between measurements) at which menses 
began (called menarche). Note that the rate of growth for each girl was declining by then.</p>

<p>Sometimes differences in the timing of puberty, whether an individual matures unusually 
early or late, causes him or her to cross percentile lines during adolescence. This should not be 
considered an indication of a growth problem, especially if the plot for the early or late 
maturing preson returns toward the range where it was initially.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="460" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/biologic2.jpg" thumbnailWidth="82" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/biologic2_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Chronologic vs. Biologic Age</title><pageText><p>Because of timing variability, chronologic age often is not a good indicator of an individual's growth status. It is possible to measure age biologically, in terms of progress towards achievement of certain development markers.</p>
<p>For dentists and orthodontists, a good way to do this is to use the stages in maturation of cervical vertebrae, which are seen in the cephalometric radiographs that are obtained for most orthodontic patients. In these two radiographs of the same individual taken 2 years apart, you can see that the cervical vertebrae (within the box) look somewhat different. For now, you just need to understand the concept of biologic age--but soon you will be learning how to estimate a patient's skeletal development age (one of many biologic ages that can be useful clinically in pediatric dentistry and orthodontics) from vertebral development seen in a radiograph. </p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="237" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p13_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="66" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s02_p13_01s.jpg"><label>Image 1, an individual at CVM 4</label><caption><p>The yellow boxes surround the second, third, and fourth cervical vertebrae.

Stage 2 indicates that peak growth at adolescence is still a year or so ahead. Stage 3 indicates that it is less than one year to peak growth, a good place to begin treatment. Stages 4, 5 and 6 are increasing distances beyond peak growth.</p>
<p>For now, you just need to understand the concept of evaluating growth using biologic markers instead of years. Later you will learn more about using both cervical vertebrae and hand-wrist bones to calculate skeletal age and how to use that knowledge to improve clinical decisions.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="234" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/timing-chrono3.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="65" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/timing-chrono3_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Timing: Biologic Age</title><pageText><p>These biologic ages also could be called developmental or maturation ages. Many different 
types of maturation, not just the skeletal age calculated from vertebrae or other skeletal 
indicators, can be determined and quantified in biologic terms. Dentists use dental age all 
the time, judging the state of development of the dentition against the usual chronologic 
markers. You will be learning about that in detail later in this course.</p>

<p>For example, from the standard charts it would be possible to calculate a height age. 
When you're the height of an average nine year old (just over 130 cms), your height age is 9, 
regardless of your chronologic age. Intellectual development can be calculated in the same 
way. Intellectual development relative to chronologic age usually is called IQ, for 
intelligence quotient, but it's just another developmental age.</p>

<p>It is interesting that the various developmental ages tend to be highly correlated. If 
you're bigger than other children the same age, you're probably also more developed 
mentally and socially. Correlated, of course, doesn't mean that this is always the 
case, just that it's more likely to be that way.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="393" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/biologic1.jpg" thumbnailWidth="70" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/biologic1_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Timing: Biologic Age (cont.)</title><pageText><p>The use of biologic age is a way to control timing as a variable in growth studies. 
Look again at the growth curves for our three girls with early, average and late 
menarche (image 1). Now use menarche as a biologic marker and call that time zero and 
plot growth increments before and after (image 2).</p>

<p>Note how similar the growth curves are for the group of girls after this simple 
transformation. They all had a very similar acceleration of growth leading up to 
menarche and decrease afterward. Using chronologic age instead of biologic age often 
can be misleading when developmental events are studied, as we will see when we 
consider cross-sectional vs longitudingal studies.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="460" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/biologic2.jpg" thumbnailWidth="82" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/biologic2_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption/></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="408" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/biologic3.jpg" thumbnailWidth="72" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/biologic3_s.jpg"><label>Image 2</label><caption/></resource></resources></page></pages></section><section><title>Methods for Studying Growth</title><pages><page pageType="content"><title>Introduction: Types of Growth Data</title><pageText><p>Growth studies may either be longitudinal or cross-sectional in design. When you look at growth data, it is important to know whether the study was longitudinal or cross-sectional.</p>
<p>In cross-sectional studies, rather than seeing the same individual at age 9,10,11, etc., data are taken for a group of 9 year olds, a different group of 10 year olds, another different group of 11 year olds, and so on. This is quicker and easier, but the amount of individual variation tends to be understated. The mean for the group (the dark line in this figure) when chronologic age is used as the time base gives a very misleading picture of what happens to any individual.</p>
<p>Longitudinal studies, in which the same individual is followed over time, provide more information about individual variation, but these studies take a long time and become quite expensive. Note that longitudinal data give a much better picture of what an individual would experience.</p>
<p>Now remember the effect of plotting the individual data with menarche as a base. Using biologic age in that way with cross-sectional data can make it easier to avoid distortions due to different timing in different individuals.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="360" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/03_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="64" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/03_01_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Longitudinal Growth, Distance</title><pageText><p>This graph shows the first published longitudinal study of growth, done by the French aristocrat De Montebillard in the 1700's.

Did somebody do this for you?</p>
<p>You can see that the growth in height didn't occur in a steady fashion.

on measurements of human skulls (or other bones, in which case it would be 
osteometry).</p>

<p>Although most craniometric studies have been done on the remains of populations 
from earlier times, study of contemporary skulls or other bones obviously would 
be possible. Distortions of the skull during growth can occur, and now are understood 
better after study of skeletal remains. A good example is the effect 
of premature fusion of sutures.</p>

<p>In the individual shown in image 1, the mid-sagittal 
suture fused prematurely and was entirely missing in adult life. Note 
the extremely narrow width of the cranium. In compensation, the brain 
and skull became abnormally long posteriorly. In image 2, note the effect 
of, premature fusion of sutures on the right side of the cranial base. This led to

Various landmarks on the skull were established by investigators studying skeletal material, and the soft tissue points overlying those landmarks (or other soft tissue points that can be found repeatedly) can be used to study living individuals.</p>
<p>Varying soft tissue thickness introduces a source of error if the goal is to measure growth of the facial skeleton, but it is highly advantageous to follow the growth of an individual directly, making the same measurement repeatedly at different times.</p>
<p>This produces longitudinal rather than cross-sectional data and shows individual variation much more precisely. Much of what we know about cranial and facial growth was first deduced from anthropometric studies. Anthropometric measurements are still important in clinical examination of orthodontic patients. They are used now primarily to establish facial proportions--which are important in planning orthodontic treatment.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="315" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/03_09.jpg" thumbnailWidth="56" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/03_09_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Anthropometric measurement of bi-zygomatic width, which is important in clinical

<p>It allows direct measurement of the skeleton because the soft tissue thickness can be 
ignored—but the soft tissues also are imaged and can be measured if desired.</p>

<p>Proper positioning of the subject in a head holder is necessary, so that repeated

<p>But cephalometric radiographs give an excellent view of many skeletal and dental structures that aren't accessible for anthropometric study, and these radiolographs are used routinely in dentistry to monitor growth and treatment of patients.

<p>That doesn't work with 3-D images, but now it is possible to superimpose on surface contours, and changes between sequential 3-D images can be discerned by color maps. This allows you to look at the amount of change at thousands of points that can be viewed from any orientation, instead of being limited to tens of points seen from one orientation in a cephalometric radiograph. The superimposed images here show changes in the position of the jaws created in an adult by orthognathic surgery to reposition his maxilla and mandible, but the same approach can be used in growth studies, and such studies now are being undertaken.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="447" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s03_p11_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="79" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/s03_p11_01s.jpg"><label>Cone Beam CT Superimposition</label><caption><p>Changes created by surgery to advance the maxilla and set back the mandible in this patient.

Bone that was growing at the time the dye was injected is stained, and the amount of growth between two injections or since the last injection can be seen.</p>
<p>The technique goes back to the famous English anatomist John Hunter, who observed that the dyes in textile wastes fed to pigs stained their bones in interesting ways. He experimented to find which dyes were best for staining bone. Alizarin proved to be best.</p>
<p>This young rat had four injections of alizarin dye at 2-week intervals, first red, then blue, then red again, then blue again. The dye is excreted rapidly, so the staining occurs during only a few hours after each injection.</p>
<p>As you look carefully at the mandible (image A, the condylar process is in the center), you can see the sequential bands of color. The white bone at the tip of the condylar process grew there since the last injection. Both the sites of growth and the rate of growth in various areas can be seen. The sites of growth are the areas where new bone is being formed, or removed by the remodeling that accompanies bone growth. The rate of growth is shown by the distance between bands of color that were deposited at known times when the dye was injected.</p>
<p>Image B shows the zygomatic arch. Note that new bone is being formed on the outside of the arch, while bone is being resorbed on the inside. The arch is growing outward by being constantly remodeled. In a view like this one, you can not only see where changes are occurring, you can tell how quickly if you know the timing of injections of the dye.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="351" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/03_17.jpg" thumbnailWidth="62" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/03_17_s.jpg"><label>Vital Staining of (A) mandible and (B) zygomatic arch</label><caption><p>Bands of alizarin staining in this preparation of the ramus of the mandible (A) indicate where bone was forming at the time of the injection.

Radioactively labeled 
substances are injected, tissue specimens are prepared, and when photographic film is exposed 
by placing it over the tissue specimen in the dark, the location of radioactive materials in 
the tissue is revealed as radiation activates silver grains in the film layer.</p>

<p>This is an autoradiograph of a small bone that was growing in organ culture. Tritium-labelled 
thymidine was incorporated into the culture medium, and was taken up when DNA of new cells was 
formed at the time of cell division. The black dots are nuclei that contain the labeled thymidine, 
which means they must have been formed by cell division that occurred since the tritiated 
thymidine was added to the culture medium.</p>

<p>In this experiment, carbon 14-labelled proline also was added to the medium. Proline, an amino 
acid, is a major constituent of collagen, which in turn is the major component of connective tissues 
and bone matrix. The dark label away from the cell nuclei shows where proline is being incorporated 
into newly-formed collagen, and therefore shows where collagen formation is taking place. Note 
that it is most active in the area where maturing collagen is being replaced by bone spicules. 
With radioactive labeling, essentially any substance can be turned into the equivalent of a 
vital stain.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="394" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/03_18.jpg" thumbnailWidth="122" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/03_18_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Implant Radiology</title><pageText><p>Implant radiology is based on visualizing metal pins placed in the skeleton. Perhaps you 
know that when bones are fractured, metal pins often are placed to hold them while they heal, 
and often the pins are left in place. A long time after the fracture has healed, the pin will 
still be visible on x-rays as a marker of the fracture site. It is possible experimentally 
to place small metallic implants in bones anywhere in the skeleton, including the face and 
jaws, as permanent markers.</p>

<p>This girl has small pieces of tantalum wire in her jaws, placed in areas where little growth 
occurs, as markers, so that the changes in jaw contours as she grows can be followed more 
precisely. The implants were placed from inside the mouth by anesthetizing the muscosa over 
the area where the implant is to be placed, then using small spring-loaded device to drive 
the implant through the soft tissue into the bone. It is a simple and painless procedure. 
When another cephalogram is taken later, one can superimpose on the markers, and then 
changes due to remodeling of the surfaces of the bone can be seen clearly.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="455" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/img2-17.jpg" thumbnailWidth="81" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="studyphysgrowth/images/img2-17_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Implant Radiology (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Implants have been placed in a number of children whose growth pattern was followed 
longitudinally, using cephalometric x-rays to detect the location of the pins. Then the 
pins were used to superimpose the outline of the jaws, so that growth changes could be 
seen relative to the pins.</p>

<p>This method was originated by Professor Bjork in Copenhagen, and has been responsible 
for much of our current understanding of jaw growth patterns. In this superimposition on 
pins in the mandible, you can see that bone was added to the posterior surface of the 
ramus and to the condylar and coronoid processes, but was removed from the gonial angle 
area. Note also that a great deal of remodeling of the condyles occurred. What was once 
the condyle at age 4 became a part of the ramus at age 10, and then was partially resorbed 
away as the condylar process continued to grow upward. Note also how the teeth erupted 
upward and forward relative to the pins in stable areas of the bone. Until cephalometric 
superimpositions on markers was done, the large amount of remodeling of the bone as the 
jaws grew had not been appreciated.</p>
