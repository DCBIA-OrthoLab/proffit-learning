almost always is to move some of the teeth (perhaps a lot) while maintaining 
other teeth in their original position (or at least as close to it as 
possible). How do you do that? The answer is &#8220;With some difficulty, 
because this requires consideration of orthodontic anchorage&#8221;.</p>

<p>The objectives of this module are to help you understand anchorage, how it 
traditionally has been controlled, and how temporary skeletal anchorage is 
used in contemporary treatment.</p>

grasps the bottom beneath it, and is generalized to relate to how other 
structures are held in place against forces that would displace them.</p>

<p>Orthodontic anchorage is a special use of the term. It is best defined as 
&#8220;resistance to unwanted tooth movement&#8221;, which contains a 
reference to what the dentist desires. That seems a strange way to put 
it, but it&#8217;s the clearest way to understand what happens in typical 
orthodontic treatment. The dentist or orthodontist activates an orthodontic 
appliance to produce certain desired tooth movements. For every action, 
there&#8217;s an equal and opposite reaction, and the anchorage is the 
resistance to reaction forces. Usually it is provided by other teeth; 
occasionally by the palate, head or neck; and increasingly now by anchors 
screwed into the bone.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s begin with other teeth as anchor units. The essence of anchorage 
is its use to produce differential tooth movement, which is more movement of 
the teeth you&#8217;re trying to move than of the teeth that you don&#8217;t 
want to move. That&#8217;s done by taking advantage of the relationship of 
tooth movement to pressure in the periodontal ligament (PDL), as shown in this 
graph. What&#8217;s the optimal force for moving a tooth? It&#8217;s the 
lightest force (and resulting pressure in the PDL) that will produce tooth 
movement at a near-maximum rate. Why is that the optimal force? Because of 
anchorage considerations that we need to discuss.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-14.gif" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="348" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-14_s.gif" thumbnailWidth="138" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Relationship of tooth movement to pressure in the PDL</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Pressure in the PDL and Differential Tooth Movement</title><pageText><p>How can you arrange things with dental anchorage so that differential tooth 
movement occurs? The slope of the curve gives the answer: that could occur 
only if the pressure in the PDL of the anchor teeth was less than the 
pressure in the PDL of the tooth you&#8217;re trying to move, and if you 
were on the vertical leg of the graph.</p>

<p>Consider the situation when the reaction force for movement of one tooth 
(M<sub>1</sub> on the graph) is spread over two or more teeth that serve 
as anchors (A<sub>1</sub>). The reaction force is equal and opposite, but 
because it is distributed over a larger PDL volume, PDL pressure would be 
lower for the anchor teeth. They would move less than the tooth on which the 
force was concentrated. The larger the PDL volume over which the reaction 
force was distributed relative to the tooth we&#8217;re trying to move, the 
greater the relative movement would be.</p>

<p>As a general guideline, the ratio between PDL pressures for the movement 
tooth and anchor teeth should be at least 3:1. The larger the ratio, the 
better the anchorage, and vice versa.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-17-1.gif" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="351" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-17-1_s.gif" thumbnailWidth="137" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Pressure in the PDL and Differential Tooth Movement (cont.)</title><pageText><p>What would happen if you increased the force against the tooth 
you&#8217;re trying to move, so that it was greater than the optimal 
force? Dentists often act as if they believed the old adage that &#8220;if 
a little bit is good, more must be better&#8221;. Increasing the force 
against the movement tooth would equally increase the reaction force. The 
effect would be to move M<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> further along the 
response curve.</p>

<p>Note the unintended effect: now the movement tooth moves only a little 
more than it did with the optimal force, while the anchor teeth move a lot 
more. The heavier force was meant to increase the desired tooth movement. What 
it really did was increase the undesired tooth movement. This is referred to 
as &#8220;burning the anchorage&#8221;, or perhaps as blowing or slipping it. 
Whatever you call it, using more than the optimal force destroys the anchorage 
value of the teeth that were meant to provide anchorage.</p>

<p>The important principle is that light forces allow control of anchorage and 
heavy forces make anchorage control impossible.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-17-2.gif" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="353" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-17-2_s.gif" thumbnailWidth="136" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Anchorage Value of Different Teeth</title><pageText><p>It should be apparent now that all teeth are not created equal from an 
anchorage perspective. The bigger the tooth and the larger its PDL volume, 
the greater its anchorage value should be.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to calculate the PDL volume, but because only one part of the 
total volume is loaded at any one time, a two-dimensional representation of 
PDL area actually is more useful in determining the anchorage value of a given 
tooth. It&#8217;s certainly true that the anchorage value of a canine is 
greater than that of an incisor, and the anchorage value of a molar is greater 
than that of a canine. You can turn that around. If a canine is to be moved, 
more force will be needed to do so, and there would be more stress on the 
anchor teeth than if an incisor was being moved.</p>

<p>This image shows the calculated anchorage value of various teeth. The relative 
values, not the absolute numbers, are what we&#8217;re interested in.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-16.jpg" resourceWidth="508" resourceHeight="450" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-16_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="90" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption/></resource></resources></page></pages></section><section><title>Types of Anchorage</title><pages><page pageType="content"><title>Reciprocal Anchorage</title><pageText><p>The simplest type of anchorage is called reciprocal anchorage. It would occur 
when movement of one tooth (like a maxillary central incisor) was pitted 
against one exactly like it (the other central incisor). That could easily 
occur in the closure of a maxillary central diastema. Not surprisingly, the 
result would be that both teeth would have the same pressure in the PDL, and 
they would move toward each other equally.</p>

<p>The same thing would happen if one group of teeth were pitted against 
another group with equal anchorage value. Suppose the first molar and 
second premolar were the anchorage unit for retraction of the canine and 
two incisors after first premolar extraction. If you look back at the 
previous figure, you&#8217;ll see that the anchorage values of those teeth are 
close to the same. All other things being equal, the tooth movement would be 
reciprocal or close to it.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-15.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="292" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-15_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="165" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Reinforced Anchorage</title><pageText><p>Suppose the goal was to close a first premolar extraction space by retracting 
the incisors and canine more than the premolar and molar moved forward. One 
strategy would be to add the second molar to the posterior anchorage unit. 
That would increase the anchorage value of the posterior unit. Now you would 
have to be sure that the force was optimal for moving the anterior teeth. If 
so, the force against the posterior anchor unit would produce a PDL pressure 
below the optimal level, and those teeth would not move forward as much 
(image 1). Adding the extra molar to the anchorage unit is described as 
"reinforcing the anchorage".</p>

<p>The principle of reinforcement of anchorage can be generalized to refer to 
anchorage outside the dental arch. One example is the use of extra-oral 
force (headgear) to reinforce anchorage. Could you control forward movement of 
posterior anchorage by having your patient wear headgear to the upper first 
molars (image 2)? The answer would have to be yes, because the headgear force 
would counteract some of the reaction force from the anterior teeth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately neither the magnitude nor the duration of headgear force is 
conducive to reinforcing anchorage. Ideally, the amount of force would be 
light and its duration would be very long if not continuous. Headgear force 
tends to be heavy, and even the most conscientious patient doesn&#8217;t come 
close to wearing it all the time. Headgear for growth modification is more 
successful than headgear for anchorage reinforcement. The wrong force and 
duration for tooth movement explain why.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-17-3.gif" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="359" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-17-3_s.gif" thumbnailWidth="134" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption/></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_13-40b.jpg" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_13-40b_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>Headgear like this is ineffective as reinforcement of posterior anchorage.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Stationary Anchorage</title><pageText><p>Another strategy to increase the anchorage value is to take advantage of the 
different loading of the PDL for bodily movement vs. tipping. Since a force is 
distributed over twice as much PDL area for bodily movement as for tipping, 
you would move a tooth twice as much as its anchor if the anchor could only 
move bodily while the movement tooth was allowed to tip. Arranging the force and 
moments on the anchor unit so those teeth can only move bodily is called 
"stationary anchorage".</p>

<p>This strategy applies very well to the situation when an anterior unit (canine 
plus incisors) is to be retracted more than its posterior anchor unit moves 
forward. If the incisors are allowed to tip while the posterior teeth have to 
move bodily, the optimum pressure for the anterior unit would be produced by 
about half as much force as if those teeth were to be moved bodily. The 
reaction force over the posterior unit would be only half the amount for 
optimal bodily movement, and then the anterior teeth would be retracted twice 
as much. This image shows the outcome.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not a total net gain because the roots of the anterior teeth 
would have to be repositioned later, but two-stage movement of a unit to be 
moved often is used to reduce the strain on anchorage. Again, note that this 
works only if the force is kept below the optimum for movement of the anchor 
unit. Using too much force would totally destroy this method of anchorage 
control.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-18.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="409" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-18_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="117" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Stationary anchorage: the posterior anchor unit can only move bodily</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Cortical Anchorage</title><pageText><p>It is obvious that anchorage could be both reinforced and stationary, and the 
combination of more teeth in the anchor unit and allowing the anchor teeth 
only to move bodily is frequently used clinically.</p>

<p>Another aspect of anchorage is seen in the different remodeling response of 
cortical and medullary bone. Teeth normally are in medullary bone, which 
remodels relatively quickly adjacent to a stressed PDL. Cortical bone can and 
does remodel, but it does so much more slowly. You can say that cortical bone 
has a higher anchorage value, but usually when it&#8217;s a factor in 
anchorage, it&#8217;s opposes the desired tooth movement, so it creates 
greater resistance to tooth movement rather than contributing to the 
anchorage.</p>

<p>A good example is seen in the area where a tooth was lost years previously 
(images 1 and 2). Almost always the alveolar process has become narrower and 
shorter. Closing a space like that requires remodeling of cortical bone, and 
that puts great stress on anchor teeth. An old extraction site, particularly 
in adults, can be so difficult to close that often it is not good judgment to 
try to do it.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-19a.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="400" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_9-19a_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Early loss of 2nd primary molars in a patient with congenital absence of

on resistance to sliding, which cannot be avoided in patients (though it can 
in a laboratory where brackets are moved along a wire without the 
inconvenience of having roots on teeth). Laboratory data of that type can 
look good in an advertising brochure but are irrelevant to clinical treatment.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s consider the impact of resistance to sliding (RS) on anchorage, 
using the familiar setting of closure of an extraction space when retraction 
of protruding incisor teeth is desired. A 60-40 ratio of anterior to 
posterior movement (image 1) often is all that is needed. Too much retraction 
of the anterior teeth can have an adverse effect on lip support and facial 
appearance.</p>

<p>If you wanted to retract the anterior segment further than that, what would you 
do? Reinforce the anchorage, of course, or make it stationary while allowing the 
anterior teeth to tip. It&#8217;s possible to use the teeth in the opposite 
arch for anchorage reinforcement (image 2), and there&#8217;s also an exciting 
new possibility that we&#8217;ll discuss at the end of this module.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-31.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="405" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-31_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="118" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption/></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-29.jpg" resourceWidth="540" resourceHeight="450" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-29_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="96" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 2</label><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Resistance to Sliding and Anchorage Control Strategies (cont.)</title><pageText><p>How much force does it take to move the canine and 2 incisors (on each side) 
posteriorly? The canine will need to move bodily (100 gm), the incisors can 
be allowed to tip back somewhat (~75 gm each), with a total of about 250 gm 
per side. But if an archwire has to slide through brackets on the posterior 
teeth, at least 100 gm has to be added to overcome the RS. The result will be 
force levels on the posterior teeth that pull them up onto the plateau of the 
force / response curve, decreasing their anchorage value.</p>

<p>The problem is aggravated because RS cannot be known precisely, and the 
clinician is tempted to be sure there&#8217;s enough force to close the 
space&#8212;so the amount of force is likely to be moved up. Even if the 
anchorage is reinforced by adding the second molars, the posterior teeth 
are likely to move forward as much as the anterior ones move back.</p>

<p>What to do? If space closure by sliding is planned, the space closure almost 
has to be done in two stages, first retracting the canine (100 gm + RS), then 
adding it to the posterior anchorage unit as the incisors are retracted 
(image 1). There still will be forward movement of the posterior anchor 
teeth, but this two-stage method allows more retraction of the incisors.</p>

<p>The alternative is to move segments of wire with the teeth attached, so that 
there is no sliding of brackets along a wire (image 2). This can be 
accomplished with loops that form the retraction spring. Then the typical 
incisor retraction could be achieved in one step, pitting the entire 
anterior segment against the posterior anchorage. The price of resistance 
to sliding then becomes clearer: the difficulty of controlling anchorage as 
teeth slide along an archwire increases treatment time to achieve the desired 
result.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-30.gif" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="262" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-30_s.gif" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="72"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Two-stage space closure, retracting the canine by itself initially, then

it&#8217;s necessary to be careful to use the right amount of force and use 
couples appropriately to obtain the desired MF / MC ratio. Otherwise, 
it&#8217;s easy to destroy the value of dental anchorage. It can be 
surprisingly difficult to be sure what forces and moments are produced 
by an orthodontic appliance because as the force system becomes more 
complex, it also is likely to become indeterminate.</p>

<p>A determinate force system means that you can measure, and therefore 
determine, the force and moments felt by all teeth. An indeterminate 
force system means that it is impossible to know exactly what forces and 
moments are produced.</p>

<p>What makes a force system indeterminate? The answer is that a one-couple 
system is determinate, while two-couple systems are indeterminate. 
What&#8217;s a one-couple system? Simply a system in which a couple is 
present at only one place, and a force or forces without a couple are felt 
elsewhere. Two-couple systems have forces and couples present in at least 
two places.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/complex_force_table.gif" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/complex_force_table_s.gif" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Determinate vs. Indeterminate Force Systems (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Removable appliances rarely become two-couple systems&#8212;they have enough 
trouble producing one moment, much less two. So although they are not very 
efficient, you can at least know what forces and moments are being delivered.</p>

<p>Multi-bracketed fixed appliances with a continuous arch wire easily become 
two-couple systems. A two-couple system is guaranteed if you place a 
rectangular wire in rectangular brackets. The rectangular wire creates a 
couple within the bracket in the torque plane of space if there is any 
twist when it is inserted (image 1) and the wire also can create couples 
across the bracket, in the mesio-distal inclination plane of space, if it 
is bent as it is inserted. A round wire also can produce couples across a 
bracket if the wire is flexed as it goes into the bracket (image 2). The 
result is that with a typical fixed appliance, it&#8217;s impossible to 
know exactly what the forces and moments are.</p>

<p>Up to this point you&#8217;ve probably thought about orthodontic tooth 
movement being a smooth continuous action. With a fixed appliance 
it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s more like a dance of the teeth. When the wire is 
inserted, a complex force system (almost surely a two-couple system) is 
established. As tooth movement begins, one tooth moves a little, which 
changes the force system and produces a response by another tooth, and so 
on. If you made a movie from images taken every 10 minutes over several days, 
you&#8217;d have something like one you&#8217;ve probably seen that shows a 
flower unfolding as the blossom opens. The dance is tolerable because the 
form of the arch wire limits how far teeth can move, and so the outcome is 
predictable although the steps to get there are not.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-21.jpg" resourceWidth="586" resourceHeight="450" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-21_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="104" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption/></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-15b.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="400" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-15b_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 2</label><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Intrusion: A Major Indication for a One-Couple System</title><pageText><p>You will remember that intrusion requires very light force, on the order of 
10 gm / tooth. With even the springiest superelastic NiTi wire, the force 
between brackets on adjacent teeth will be about 50 gm, which is perfect for 
tipping teeth into alignment. But if the brackets are not vertically aligned, 
there also will be a extrusive force of 50 gm on one tooth and a 50 gm 
intrusive force on the somewhat elongated one next to it. That&#8217;s 
also perfect for extrusion, but the 50 gm intrusive force has no effect 
until undermining resorption can take place, and that&#8217;s particularly 
slow because of the dense bone beneath the teeth.</p>

<p>The result is that a continuous arch wire is extrusive. It aligns the 
brackets much more by extruding a relatively depressed tooth than by intruding 
an elongated one.</p>

<p>How do you set up an appliance for intrusion? This requires two things: a long 
span of wire that bypasses some teeth (so that it will deliver the necessary 
light force), and the absence of a couple where it attaches to the incisor 
teeth. A light round steel wire from bands on first molars to brackets only 
on the incisors can meet both of these requirements. It&#8217;s often called a 
2 x 4 appliance: 2 molar bands, 4 incisor brackets (image 1). It can generate 
a light vertical force at the incisors, and it produces a couple across the 
molar tube but doesn&#8217;t create a couple anteriorly. The problem is that 
the two molars aren&#8217;t much anchorage, and the reaction force from the 
incisors tends to tip the molars distally.</p>

<p>Better control is obtained by creating a multi-tooth anchorage segment, and 
using a one-couple intrusion arch formed from a rectangular wire. It inserts 
into an auxiliary tube on the molar but bypasses the 
brackets on other teeth, and is tied to a segment of wire in the teeth to be 
intruded (image 2). Tying it to the wire rather than placing it into the 
brackets keeps it a one-couple system, so that the intrusion force can be 
measured precisely. For two teeth to be intruded, it should deliver 20 gm.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_14-25ab.jpg" resourceWidth="339" resourceHeight="450" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_14-25ab_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="60" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>2 x 4 appliance.

system is to tie a rectangular intrusion arch into the brackets on incisors. 
This creates one couple at the molar, another couple anteriorly. The clinical 
observation is that such an auxiliary intrusion arch is unpredictable in its 
effects. Sometimes excellent intrusion is obtained. Sometimes there is little 
intrusion, with reaction forces strongly expressed at the molars. Why? 
Because even though the wire is adjusted so that it would deliver a 30-40 gm 
intrusion force (appropriate for 4 lower incisors) when it&#8217;s deflected 
up to the level of the bracket, as soon as it&#8217;s tied into the anterior 
brackets, the actual intrusion force is unknown.</p>

<p>The bottom line: you can&#8217;t intrude teeth with a continuous arch wire, 
and for all practical purposes you can&#8217;t do it with a two-couple system 
even if it bypasses brackets to reduce the force it delivers. You can do it 
with a one-couple system.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-36a.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="367" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-36a_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="131" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>A two-couple system, created when an intrusion arch is tied into anterior

repositioned. What would happen if you pulled against it? Once even a 
small part of the tooth root is fused to the bone (no PDL in that area), 
the tooth can&#8217;t move no matter how hard you pull on it. Any tooth 
movement would occur in what was meant to be the anchorage unit.</p>

<p>That unfortunate situation occurs sometimes during efforts to bring a badly 
impacted maxillary canine into the arch. If the canine ankyloses before it 
reaches its normal position in the arch and efforts to move it continue, 
there can be major displacements of the other maxillary teeth. The only way 
to move an ankylosed tooth is to create a bony segment that includes it, and 
move the segment by distraction osteogenesis. Although that&#8217;s possible, 
it&#8217;s rarely feasible. Usually it&#8217;s better to extract such a 
tooth&#8212;especially now that an implant to replace it is quite possible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an ankylosed tooth would be perfect anchorage if it was in 
the right place. Since an implant is the equivalent of an ankylosed tooth, 
could it serve as an anchor for tooth movement? Yes, it can. Implants easily

for restorative purposes, would be easily removable after its orthodontic use? 
The answer to that also is yes. Temporary anchorage devices (TADs) now are 
coming into widespread use in orthodontics, especially in adults but also in 
adolescents. The lower age limit for TADs is about age 11. In children younger 
than that, the bone is not mature enough to maintain a bone anchor.</p>

<p>TADs take two forms: bone screws placed in alveolar bone, and mini-plates 
that are attached to basal bone beneath the teeth with multiple bone screws. 
Bone screws work very well when they serve as the anchorage for repositioning 
specific teeth. Mini-plates are advantageous when more extensive tooth 
movement is needed.</p>

<p>A typical application of a bone screw as an anchor for tooth movement is 
shown in the attached images. The goal for this patient, who had lost almost 
all her posterior teeth, was to align the remaining lower anterior teeth 
without protruding them. There weren&#8217;t any posterior teeth to serve as 
anchorage. A single bone screw was placed into the remaining alveolar bone on 
the right side. It provided the anchorage to retract the first premolar so 
that the canine could be rotated into proper position. Then comprehensive 
prosthodontic treatment could be done without concern for the occlusal 
interference posed by the displaced canine or any need to adapt the partial 
denture (whether fixed or removable) to the irregular anterior teeth.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-49a.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="378" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-49a_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="127" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Canine crossbite and interference prior to treatment</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-49b.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="379" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-49b_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="127" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>Pre-treatment occlusal view</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-49c.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="400" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-49c_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 3</label><caption><p>Retraction of the first premolar</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-49d.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="400" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-49d_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 4</label><caption><p>Rotation of the canine (with a superelastic wire segment)</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-49e.jpg" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="399" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-49e_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 5</label><caption><p>Alignment completed, ready for comprehensive prosthodontics</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Uses of Temporary Skeletal Anchorage</title><pageText><p>There are now four major applications of temporary skeletal anchorage in

<ul class="spaced">
<li>positioning individual teeth when no other satisfactory anchorage is

<li>retraction and intrusion of protruding maxillary incisors</li>

<li>distal movement of maxillary molars (and the entire maxillary arch if needed)</li>

<li>intrusion of posterior teeth to close an anterior open bite</li>
</ul>

<p>It now is possible also to use skeletal anchorage in growth modification

<p>This list shows an increasing need for mini-plates as opposed to alveolar bone 
screws, as you proceed from top to bottom.</p></pageText><resources/></page><page pageType="content"><title>Protruding Maxillary Incisors</title><pageText><p>Retraction of maxillary incisors with TADs can be done in three ways: using 
bone screws in the palate to stabilize a lingual arch that holds the posterior 
anchor teeth in position (image 1); using bone screws in the alveolar process 
posteriorly (image 2); or using mini-plates placed at the base of the 
zygomatic arch, with an arm projecting into the vestibule (images 3 and 4).</p>

<p>Bone screws provide excellent anchorage, but their position determines the 
vertical aspect of force against them. Often it is desirable to intrude 
severely protruding incisors as they are retracted, because tipping them to 
produce a more normal orientation brings the incisal edges down. Palatal 
anchorage makes this very difficult. The vertical position of bone screws 
can be adjusted to some extent, but screws need to be placed in attached 
gingiva rather than alveolar mucosa, which can make it difficult to obtain a 
vertical direction of force.</p>

<p>Mini-plates have the great advantage that a wire can be attached to the arm 
that extends into the oral cavity, so that the point of force application can 
be almost anywhere.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-32e.jpg" resourceWidth="444" resourceHeight="450" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_10-32e_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="79" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>A palatal bone screw stabilizes a premolar-to-premolar lingual arch, to

anteriorly until suture interdigitation reaches the point that this is no 
longer possible. Using Class III elastics from mini-plates at the zygomatic 
buttress to mini-plates on the anterior body of the mandible (images 1, 2) 
shows great promise in correcting reverse overjet by producing skeletal 
change in patients who might be a bit too old for a good facemask result. 
The elastics are much easier to wear than the facemask, and that also improves 
the chance of good cooperation.</p>

<p>This treatment, originated by Hugo DeClerck in Belgium, also is quite new. 
Some children have marked changes in the maxilla (image 3), while others 
(sutures too interdigitated?) do not have as much skeletal effect. How do 
you select the patients for this type of treatment? How stable will it be 
in the long term? You&#8217;ll be reading about that in your early years of 
practice.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/intraoral_class_iii.jpg" resourceWidth="465" resourceHeight="314" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/intraoral_class_iii_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="118" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Pretreatment occlusion, miniplates in place.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/intraoral_class_i.jpg" resourceWidth="469" resourceHeight="313" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/intraoral_class_i_s.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>Occlusion after 12 months of treatment with Class III elastics to the

Placing bone 
screws requires anesthesia (a potent topical usually is enough)&#8212;then 
the patient feels pressure as it is inserted, but minimal pain. There is some 
tissue irritation during the next few days. Mini-plates require more potent 
anesthesia, a flap to expose the bone, then sutures while it heals. Some 
swelling occurs that peaks at 2 days, and tissue irritation persists for 
another few days.</p>

<p>Despite the reaction to surgery, experience with both types of TADs shows that 
patients tolerate them quite well. The amount of pain and swelling reported in 
a group of 97 mini-plate patients is shown in image 1. This is acceptable to 
patients if they expect it.</p>

<p>The effect of mini-plates on the subsequent orthodontic treatment also is 
interesting. The 30 orthodontists who treated the same group of 97 patients 
expected the treatment to be difficult, usually very difficult (image 2, blue 
bars) because of the type of malocclusion and the treatment plan. They found 
it to be much easier than they expected. The majority of the cases were judged 
to be moderately easy (green bars), and none were judged to be very difficult.</p>

<p>The bottom line: TADs of both types are well tolerated by patients, and make 
tooth movement possible that couldn&#8217;t be done any other way. Skeletal 
anchorage won&#8217;t revolutionize orthodontics, but it certainly will be 
widely used to overcome anchorage problems.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-50.gif" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="314" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-50_s.gif" thumbnailWidth="153" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Patient reports of pain and swelling after placement of mini-plates</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-51.gif" resourceWidth="419" resourceHeight="450" thumbnailLocation="anchorage/images/fig_18-51_s.gif" thumbnailWidth="75" thumbnailHeight="80"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>Orthodontist expectations of treatment difficulty in patients with mini-plates

released. Osseointegrated implants and alveolar bone screws lack a periodontal
