and dental-facial relationships is an essential step in the diagnosis of 
malocclusion. You must develop something like x-ray vision, visualizing the 
underlying jaw relationships from looking at the patient, and you also must 
be aware of how the teeth relate to the lips and cheeks. The purpose of this 
program is to teach you how to do that.</p>

<p>This program will cover the following major topics:</p>

<li>tooth display</li>
</ul><p class="noSpaceAfter">Lateral view:</p>

<p>All normal faces have some asymmetry, and in most people the right side of the face is slightly larger than the left side (but it can be the other way around). The best way to appreciate the degree of normal asymmetry is to look at the difference in facial appearance between the real image, in the center in the illustration here, and the same face with the left and right sides duplicated. A perfectly symmetrical face doesn’t look real, because we almost never encounter an individual with no difference in the two sides of the face.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="239" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-9.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="66" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-9_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>Real image in center; on the left, two left sides as mirror image; on the right, two right sides. Note that for this boy as for most people, the right side of the face is larger.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>How Much Jaw Asymmetry is Too Much?</title><pageText><p>We don’t even see the normal asymmetry without techniques like the pictures you just looked at. At a certain point, however, facial asymmetry becomes noticeable, and when it does, the perceptions of those who view that face may be altered in an unfavorable way—which, of course, is likely to become a problem for that person. The face can be asymmetric in many different ways, but when noticeable asymmetry exists, the mandible almost always is involved (over 80% of patients with noticeable asymmetry have the mandible off to one side). An asymmetric nose is the second most likely aspect of asymmetry, and both the nose and chin are off the midline in many asymmetric faces.</p>
<p>Modern computer graphics provide a way to ask the question, “How much is too much?” That has been done for many aspects of facial appearance with a series of computer-altered images, and then patients and doctors were asked which one they preferred, without being told exactly what was being altered—their instruction was “Just select the picture you find most ideal” from the image series.</p>
<p>A series of increasingly asymmetric mandibles prepared in a similar graphics program allowed experiments to evaluate how far off the mandible has to be before it’s noticed. The answer is interesting: neither doctors nor patients consistently notice a 3 mm deviation of the chin, while both groups are likely to notice 4 mm.</p></pageText><resources/></page><page pageType="content"><title>Dental-Facial Midlines</title><pageText><p>A second important aspect of symmetry is the relationship of the midline of the upper and lower dental arches to the skeletal midline. The upper dental midline should coincide with the facial midline. As you might expect, a small deviation of a millimeter or two isn’t noticed, but larger deviations are.</p>
<p>You’re likely to encounter a patient like this adult (image 1), who complained of a “crooked smile” in trying to describe the effect of a dental midline that’s off the facial midline. Of course jaw asymmetry also could be the cause of a crooked smile. Your patients may have difficulty in describing what’s wrong, but you need to be able to determine the source of the asymmetry.</p>
<p>You’re also likely to see the midline off in a child (image 2). She may not have noticed—but her parents probably have, and if she has orthodontic treatment, that’s one thing that certainly will need to be corrected. The midline of the upper arch relative to the face is important because it is displayed with every smile. Getting the dental midlines so they coincide is important, too—but not if that would require displacing the maxillary teeth to one side.</p>
<p>Studies with computer-altered images suggest that a dental midline off the center of the face becomes noticeable, and a potential problem, when it exceeds about 3 mm (image 3).</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="388" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/midline_bowers.jpg" thumbnailWidth="69" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/midline_bowers_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Complaint: "My smile is crooked."

In the frontal view the face can be divided into a central region and two lateral regions on each side. The five regions normally are quite close to the same width. They may not be when noticeable asymmetry exists.</p>
<p>This image illustrates the transverse proportions of the face and the relationships of the mouth, nose and eyes in the transverse plane of space. Note that in a well-proportioned face:</p>
<ul><li>the distance between the eyes is the same as the width of the eye</li>
<li>the width of the nose is about the same as the distance between the eyes</li>
<li>the width of the mouth equals the inter-pupillary distance</li>
<li>the width of the mandible at the gonial angles equals the width across the eyes</li>
</ul></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-8.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-8_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>The face divided into fifths.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Vertical Facial Proportions</title><pageText><p>Vertical facial proportions are seen in both the frontal (image 1) and lateral (image 2) views. The face can be divided into three vertical regions that are normally about the same size: hairline to bridge of nose (upper face), bridge of nose to bottom of nose (mid-face), and bottom of nose to bottom of chin (lower face). The medieval artists (da Vinci, Durer) who wrote the guidelines for drawing the human face expected the three regions to be the same size. In modern populations the lower third of the face usually is a little (but only a little) longer.</p>
<p>It is interesting, and important to dentists, that the lower facial third has thirds. From the base of the nose to the mouth ideally is one-third of the total height of the lower third of the face, and from the mouth to the bottom of the chin is two-thirds.</p>
<p>Deviations from these proportions quickly are perceived as abnormal, and if other people perceive your facial proportions to be abnormal, that can become a problem that you'd like your dentist / orthodontist to help you overcome.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-11a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-11a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Normal vertical proportions, frontal view.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-11b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-11b_s.jpg"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>Normal vertical proportions, lateral view.</p></caption></resource></resources></page></pages></section><section><title>Frontal View: Tooth Display</title><pages><page pageType="content"><title>Anterior Tooth Display</title><pageText><p>An important aspect of dental-facial proportions is the extent to which the maxillary incisors can be seen when the patient is at rest and on smile. In planning dental treatment of any kind, an important objective is to obtain the appropriate amount of tooth display.</p>
<p>The amount of tooth display at rest, of course, is determined by the amount of lip separation at rest. This can be zero but usually is 2-4 mm, more in younger children than older ones, and less or zero in adults.</p>
<p>The amount of lip elevation in the “enjoyment smile” (“That’s the funniest thing I’ve heard in years!”) varies but is great enough to display much of the gingiva as well as the teeth. It’s the “social smile” that we use all the time (“Glad to meet you.”) to which dentists relate tooth display. For the social smile, the guideline is that 100% exposure of the maxillary incisor and perhaps exposure of a small amount of maxillary gingiva is ideal (image 1), and 75% exposure of the incisor is about the minimum for the best appearance (image 2).</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-22a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-22a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>An ideal social smile for a patient in late adolescence displays 100% of the crown of the incisors and a small amount of gingiva.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-22b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-22b_s.jpg"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>Display of 75% of the maxillary incisors on a social smile is about the minimum for good facial esthetics.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Anterior Tooth Display (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Perhaps the best way to appreciate the impact of incisor display is to look at the difference it can make to change incisor display with treatment.</p>
<p>The girl in these before / after images had orthodontic treatment (with premolar extractions) to align her teeth and decrease their protrusion, and then (just before the braces were removed) had a lower border osteotomy of the mandible to bring her chin upward and forward. The genioplasty didn’t affect her dental occlusion, which was quite good before it was done, but it was an important part of the overall treatment. It elevated the lower lip, greatly decreased lip separation at rest and strain on closure, and improved the relationship of the lower lip with the maxillary incisors on smile. That’s the smile arc, which you’re going to learn more about as this module continues.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="302" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/scr10-2.jpg" thumbnailWidth="54" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/scr10-2_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Pre-treatment, age 11.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="353" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/s02_p02_02.jpg" thumbnailWidth="63" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/s02_p02_02s.jpg"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>Completion of orthodontics, age 15, before genioplasty to reduce the height of the lower 2/3rds of the lower third of the face.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="295" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/scr10-1.jpg" thumbnailWidth="52" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/scr10-1_s.jpg"><label>Image 3</label><caption><p>Post-treatment, age 15.

There should be a small separation between the teeth and the cheeks, which forms the buccal corridor.</p>
<p>A wide buccal corridor detracts from the appearance of the smile and is an indication that widening the maxillary arch may be indicated in orthodontic treatment, just as it is in replacement of missing posterior teeth with full or partial dentures. By the same token, absence of a buccal corridor also detracts from the appearance of the smile—anything can be overdone, and that includes transverse expansion of the dental arch.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-23a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-23a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Narrow maxillary arch with wide buccal corridors.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-23b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-23b_s.jpg"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>5-year recall (same patient--she changed her hair color) after orthodontic treatment with widening of maxillary arch.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Smile Arc</title><pageText><p>The smile arc is the relationship of the curvature of the of the lower lip on smile to the contour of the maxillary dentition.

It is apparent, however, that the smile arc is an important aspect of smile attractiveness. One recent study (which has not been widely replicated) called it the “deal breaker” as smiles are evaluated, i.e., if the smile arch is incorrect, other aspects of positioning the teeth relative to the lips for best appearance can’t overcome it.</p>
<p>This girl’s treatment consisted of lengthening her maxillary incisors so that their vertical position matched the lip contour, and was done with dental laminates rather than orthodontics. The same guidelines for tooth-lip relationships apply to all types of dental treatment. Modern restorative dentistry can be an effective way of creating more display of the upper incisors.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-25a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-25a_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Flattened smile arc prior to treatment.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-25b.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-25b_s.jpg"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>Corrected smile arc by lengthening short maxillary incisors with dental laminates.</p></caption></resource></resources></page></pages></section><section><title>Lateral View: A-P Jaw Relationships</title><pages><page pageType="content"><title>Detecting Jaw Relationships</title><pageText><p>It’s in evaluation of jaw relationships from a profile view that you really need to develop x-ray vision. Cephalometric radiographs make it easier to see the details of how the jaws relate to each other, but you can see abnormal versus normal jaw relationships well enough from careful clinical examination of the profile to make a correct diagnosis and determine which patients may need further evaluation.</p>
<p>This works because the soft tissue contours usually reflect the hard tissue contours that underlie them. The position of the soft tissue chin is a function of the position of the bony chin beneath it. The base of the upper lip and nose reflects the position of the anterior maxilla, and the position of the upper incisor determines lip contour at the vermillion border. The contour of the lower lip similarly reflects the contours of the mandibular alveolar process and may be affected by the upper teeth. For this reason, profile analysis can tell you a lot about the position of the jaws and teeth.</p>
<p>We don't yet routinely have images like the one shown here, which was specially made to superimpose the soft tissue profile over the cephalometric radiograph. In profile analysis your goal is to infer the jaw and tooth positions from what you see of the facial soft tissue relationships.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="493" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/tissue_plus_ceph.jpg" thumbnailWidth="88" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/tissue_plus_ceph_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Class II Profile</title><pageText><p>A skeletal Class II problem means, of course, that the lower jaw is enough behind the upper jaw to make normal dental occlusion almost impossible.

<p>Is it easier to see that the lower jaw is too far back in this patient (image 1) if you draw it (image 2)? For students who are just learning to evaluate jaw relationships, the drawing seems to help. Until you sharpen your eye, developing the x-ray vision we’ve talked about, a good way to be sure you see it is to look carefully so you can draw the profile accurately. What you’re trying to see is the relationship of the jaws, and of the teeth to the jaws, as in image 3.

Approximately 1-2% of the US population has this type of skeletal relationship, which is more prevalent (up to 14%) in Asians.</p>
<p>In this girl, the Class III problem is due to a combination of a maxilla that is not as far forward as it should be, while the mandible is somewhat large. The profile sketch of a different individual (image 2) shows a similar situation. You already know that a skeletal Class III problem can be due to any combination of small / short maxilla and large / long mandible. You don’t need an x-ray to differentiate maxillary deficiency from mandibular excess.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="376" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/feeny_profile.jpg" thumbnailWidth="67" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/feeny_profile_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Class III profile, with a combination of mandibular excess and maxillary deficiency.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="420" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-13c.gif" thumbnailWidth="75" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-13c_s.gif"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>Drawing of a Class III profile.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Short Face / Deep Overbite</title><pageText><p>Vertical jaw relationships also are seen in the profile view, and appear as disproportions in the middle and/or lower thirds of the face.

<p>That’s right, she almost surely has a deep overbite. A short face is also called a skeletal deep bite, simply because the jaw relationship predisposes to that dental relationship.

though not necessarily in this order:</p>

<p>The first relates to anteroposterior skeletal jaw relationships: <i>What is the 
anteroposterior position of each jaw and how do the jaws relate to 
each other?</i></p>

<p>The second is the vertical jaw relationship: <i>What are the vertical facial 
proportions, especially in the lower 1/3 of the face?</i></p>

<p>The third is the transverse jaw relationship: <i>Is the face symmetric?</i></p>

<p>Fourth is the transverse position of the upper dental arch relative to the face: 
<i>Are the upper incisors in the center of the face? Are the buccal corridors wide, 
normal or narrow?</i></p>

<p>Fifth is the vertical incisor position: <i>Are the incisors correctly 
positioned vertically relative to the lips, so that incisor display 
is optimal?</i></p>

<p>We’ve answered these. Now let’s consider the last one:</p>

<p><i>Do the incisors provide proper lip support, or are they retrusive 
or protrusive?</i></p>

<p>Facial form analysis and space analysis are the key diagnostic 
procedures in evaluating potential orthodontic problems in children, 
and this is where they overlap. As we will emphasize further in the 
module on space analysis, you can’t interpret the result of space 
analysis until you know where the incisors are positioned in the a-p 
plane of space and, if the incisors need to be repositioned, the 
direction in which they would be moved.</p></pageText><resources/></page></pages></section><section><title>Lateral View: Tooth-Lip Relationships</title><pages><page pageType="content"><title>Lip Position Related to Incisor Position</title><pageText><p>Lip position and incisor prominence are evaluated by viewing the profile with the patient’s lips relaxed, and observing the position of the upper lip relative to a true vertical line through the concavity at the base of the upper lip (soft tissue point A) (image 1). Then the position of the lower lip relative to a true vertical line through the bottom of the concavity between the lip and chin (soft tissue point B) is observed.</p>
<p>If either lip is significantly forward from the reference line, it can be judged as protrusive; if it falls behind this line, it’s retrusive. For this girl, the lower lip is quite protrusive relative to the chin, while the prominence of the upper lip is normally-related to the base of the lip. If the lips are prominent, incompetent (separated at rest by more than 3-4 mm) (image 2) and strained on closure (image 3), the anterior teeth are excessively protrusive.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="300" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/6-17.jpg" thumbnailWidth="53" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/6-17_s.jpg"><label>Image 1</label><caption><p>Note the difference in the position of the upper lip to its base (soft tissue point A) and the lower lip relative to its base (soft tissue point B).</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="310" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/lip_incompetence.jpg" thumbnailWidth="55" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/lip_incompetence_s.jpg"><label>Image 2</label><caption><p>Excessive separation of the lips is seen particularly well in an oblique (three-quarter) view of the face.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="307" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="facialform/images/lip_strain.jpg" thumbnailWidth="55" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="facialform/images/lip_strain_s.jpg"><label>Image 3</label><caption><p>Note the lip strain when she brings her lips together.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Lip Position Related to Incisor Position (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Remember, if the lips are prominent, incompetent (separated at rest by more than 3-4 mm) (image 1) and strained on closure (image 2), the anterior teeth are excessively protrusive (image 3).</p>

facial disproportions? Why do you need to develop the ability to evaluate 
facial and dental proportions?</p>

<p>The answer is straightforward: this is the process you will use to evaluate 
the severity of an orthodontic problem and whether you would refer the 
patient to a specialist for treatment of this problem or treat it yourself. 
The process is referred to as “orthodontic triage”. It’s 
just an organized way to sort patients by the severity of their orthodontic 
problems (triage comes from the French verb trier, to sort). As you move on 
to Levels 3 and 4 in the Growth &amp; Development sequence, 
you’ll be applying your ability to detect jaw relationships and 
tooth-lip relationships as you conduct orthodontic triage.</p></pageText><resources/></page><page pageType="content"><title>Referral to Self-Test</title><pageText><p>Before you take the self-test, be sure to read the assignment in <i>Contemporary Orthodontics</i>: pages 158-172 in the 5th edition, pages 176-189 in the 4th edition.
