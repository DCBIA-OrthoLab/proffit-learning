<p>This module provides details of craniofacial growth during the preschool (primary dentition) years.</p>
<p>Be sure you do the reading (pages 66-72 in the 5th ed or pages 60-66 in the 6th ed of <i>Contemporary Orthodontics, </i>and the appropriate section in your embryology text) as well as viewing this program. The text in the book is more detailed than in this computer program, and the material in the book on maturation of function will be particularly helpful in understanding it.</p></pageText><resources/></page><page pageType="content"><title>Learning Objectives</title><pageText><p>The learning objectives for this module are to help you understand:</p>

One of the striking things to note is that the same chart is used for both genders in early life--there isn't any gender difference then, so we don't have to focus on that (yet).</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Late fetal life, birth</title><pageText><p>The dramatic growth changes of the embryonic period of life are largely complete at 3 months in utero, and the major stages of organ development end at about 6 months. During the final trimester, rapid growth continues, with a tripling of weight between about 1000 grams at 6 months to 3000 grams at 9 months. Development of all the primary teeth and the permanent first molars starts well before birth (Table 1 below).</p>
<p>This chronology is just something you have to memorize, all of it for now, the last 2 columns to stay in your memory for your professional career. Your friends and patients take it for granted that you can answer their questions about baby teeth, even if you're now as far as you can get from pediatric dentistry while still practicing dentistry.</p>
<p>Despite the cephalocaudal pattern of growth, the head at birth still represents about 50% of the total body length, and getting it through the birth canal is potentially difficult. Two anatomic features that you can see in the photo below of a newborn make delivery easier: 1) the fontanelles of the skull allow distortion of the head, making it more tubular in shape, and 2) the mandible is quite deficient relative to the maxilla and cranium, so that the chin is "tucked in" rather than protruding.</p>
<p>Birth is traumatic enough to the fetus that growth temporarily stops, and usually there is a small decrease in weight between the first 7 and 10 days of post-natal life. Because calcification of bones and teeth stops for a few days, lines due to decalcification appear in both the teeth and bones that are forming at this time. The bones are not visible and remodeling would remove these lines in the near future, but enamel does not remodel, and lines in the teeth from birth trauma can be seen as they erupt later. Usually, seeing the lines requires magnification, but a difficult neonatal period can result in an area of enamel that is stained, distorted and poorly calcified. As we have noted previously, a period of severe illness later can produce similar lines on the teeth.</p>

That depends on the degree of a tooth's development. As the figure below shows, the line on the maxillary incisors would be in the upper part of the crown, and it would be about the middle of the crown for mandibular incisors. On the primary canines and first molars, it would be below the cusp tips, and for primary second molars it would be near the cusp tips.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="575" resourceHeight="323" resourceLocation="images/placeholder.jpg" thumbnailWidth="142" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="images/placeholder_s.jpg"><label>Primary teeth on a developmental scale, showing the location of natal lines.</label><caption><p>The greater the amount of completion of a tooth crown at birth, the more gingivally a natal line would be formed.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Impact of low birth weight (premature birth)</title><pageText><p>Infants of &lt;2500 grams birth weight, which almost always reflects premature birth, are at greater risk of problems in the immediate post-natal period, and until the late 20th century, those &lt;1500 grams often did not survive. Now children of only 1000 grams often are saved, along with a few below that weight.</p>
<p>Despite their small size at birth, as the figure below shows, children judged to be small for their gestational age (SGA) and low birth weight children (premature birth) who survive make a remarkable recovery. By age 3 they usually are at about the same developmental stage as those who were normal at birth, and by age 6 they are nearly at the same height and weight  as children who were normal at birth. Some professional athletes who are well above normal height and weight as adolescents and adults have a history of premature birth.  </p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="575" resourceHeight="323" resourceLocation="images/placeholder.jpg" thumbnailWidth="142" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="images/placeholder_s.jpg"><label>Height and weight effects of premature birth       <i><b>﻿Fig 3.4</b></i></label><caption><p>Note the recovery of low birth weight infants over time.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Oral Function in the Newborn: the First Breath of Life</title><pageText><p>The principal functions of the oral cavity are respiration, swallowing, mastication and speech. You may think it odd to see respiration in first place--but there is no doubt that it's the most important bodily function from birth to the end of life, always the number one physiologic priority. Why? Because if you can't breathe, nothing else matters.</p>
<p>What's the first thing you have to do when you enter the world and your umbilical cord disconnects? Take the first breath of life, using an airway that you have to open up. And to do that, you have to do three things: 1) lift up your head so that your mandible drops down, 2) bring your tongue down and forward so that it no longer contacts the posterior pharyngeal wall, and 3) expand your chest, so that air can move through your nose, across the pharynx, and into the lungs. The newborn has about 5 minutes to accomplish this; then the airway must be maintained as long as he or she lives. In those first minutes of life, the posture of the head, posture of the tongue, and posture of the mandible were established. That doesn't mean those characteristics can't be changed in the future. It does mean that any changes must be compatible with maintenance of the airway.</p>
<p>It's interesting and significant that a newborn infant can't breathe through the mouth, so if the nasal airway is blocked, that's a major problem. If necessary, an opening through the trachea is life-saving; fortunately, that's rarely necessary. </p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="575" resourceHeight="323" resourceLocation="images/placeholder.jpg" thumbnailWidth="142" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="images/placeholder_s.jpg"><label>Radiographic image of the first breath of life       <i><b>must find this in slide (or just delete the image)</b></i></label><caption><p><i>﻿</i>This is an image of an x-ray movie of an infant taken immediately upon delivery for imaging of the first breath, in a unique study in Scandinavia by James Bosma, an American professor of pediatrics.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Suckling, not sucking</title><pageText><p>Once an airway is established, the newborn's next priority is to obtain milk and transfer it into the gastro-intestinal system. This requires two movements: suckling (not sucking) and swallowing.</p>
<p>The milk ducts of mammals are surrounded by smooth muscle, which squirts milk out of the nipple when it contracts. The infant's initial goal is to stimulate its mother to release milk, and this is done with stimulatory nibbling contact with the nipple--which is correctly described as suckling. The infant places the tip of its tongue beneath the nipple, so that the milk is delivered to the top of the tongue, and transfer through the mouth requires only grooving of the tongue so that the milk slides through the mouth without further effort by the infant. Sucking isn't required and probably wouldn't work anyway.</p>
<p>In the first months of life, typical tongue posture is with the tongue tip pressed against the lower lip (Fig. 1). If you gently move the lip, the tongue tip will follow it.</p>
<p>Confusion between suckling and sucking has led to some strange thoughts about the design of bottles for feeding infants. Should an infant have to fight with an artifical nipple that would release only very small quantities of milk (Fig. 2)? No, a good mother supplies the milk generously when stimulated to do so, and a good artificial nipple should also do that.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="575" resourceHeight="323" resourceLocation="images/placeholder.jpg" thumbnailWidth="142" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="images/placeholder_s.jpg"><label>Infant tongue tip position       <i><b>Fig. 3-8 in C Orthod</b></i></label><caption><p>A characteristic posture of the tongue by an infant is to have the tongue tip against the lower lip. The tongue tip follows the lower lip when the lips are separated as milk is provided, putting it in the right place to receive the milk.</p></caption></resource><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="575" resourceHeight="323" resourceLocation="images/placeholder.jpg" thumbnailWidth="142" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="images/placeholder_s.jpg"><label>An "orthodontic nipple"           <i><b>﻿from lecture slide</b></i></label><caption><p>The theory of this device is that from the beginning, an infant should have to suck hard to get milk; otherwise he or she would develop bad habits. Since that's not at all how normal development works, it's fortunate that nipples of this type usually are discarded quickly because they increase feeding time and decrease infant satisfaction.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Developmental stages in swallowing</title><pageText><p>What we just described is the infantile swallow, with the lips contracted around a nipple and milk flowing through the mouth with little activity of the posterior tongue or pharyngeal musculature. The suckling reflex and the infantile swallow normally disappear during the first year of life.</p>
<p>As semi-solid food is added to the infant's diet, the child must use the tongue to gather up the material, position it along the middle of the tongue, and move it posteriorly. By the time the primary molars begin to erupt, a juvenile chewing pattern has developed, and a juvenile swallow pattern has been established. This is characterized by continued activity of the lips but elevation of the tongue tip, use of the mandibular elevator muscles to stabilize the position of the mandible, and increasing elevation and activity of the posterior tongue. Maturation of tongue function follows a front-to-back sequence.</p>
<p>The juvenile swallowing pattern gradually transitions to the adult swallow, in which tongue contact with the lips and active lip contraction are replaced with lateral movements of the tongue to gather a food bolus after chewing, placement of the tongue tip against the palate behind the incisor teeth, and a wave of tongue activity to move the along the surface of the palate into the pharynx, where it is deposited into the esophagus. This can develop as early as age 3, but has occurred in only about 50% of children by the time they enter school at age 6, and never completely develops in some individuals. The juvenile pattern is sometimes referred to as a "tongue thrust swallow". We will discuss its clinical implications (or lack of them) later as we review oral function as a factor in the development of malocclusion.</p></pageText><resources/></page><page pageType="content"><title>Juvenile vs. adult chewing movements</title><pageText><p>As the ability to chew develops, children move their jaw laterally, and then bring it back toward the midline as they bite down. This eventually transfers to the quite different adult chewing pattern, in which the individual opens the mouth with a largely vertical movement, and then swings the jaw laterally as they bite down. There is no evidence that the adult pattern is more effective. Instead, it seems to have to do with canine function. With primary canines present, there is little restraint to early lateral movement of the jaw; when the permanent canines erupt and come into function, it is necessary to open vertically initially, and continued vertical motion before lateral jaw movement becomes an adaptation to the new dental occlusion.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the change in jaw movement pattern, it develops at about age 12 as the permanent canines erupt, and in adults with a severe anterior open bite who never bring their canines into occlusion, the juvenile chewing pattern persists.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="575" resourceHeight="323" resourceLocation="images/placeholder.jpg" thumbnailWidth="142" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="images/placeholder_s.jpg"><label>Adult vs. child chewing movements        <i><b>﻿Fig 3.9</b></i></label><caption><p>The chewing pattern for children includes lateral movement of the jaw at a small amount of opening, and wide variation in jaw movement as chewing continues, with a swing back toward the midline. The adult pattern is more organized and consistent, with lateral jaw movement on closure rather than opening.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Stages in the acquisition of speech</title><pageText><p>The accquisition of speech provides a clear view of the gradient from anterior to posterior in maturation of oral function. The first speech sounds-- /m/, /b/ and /p/ --come contact of the lips to shape the air stream as the child breathes out, and this occurs along with the transition from infantile to juvenile swallowing. That's why the first words a child masters are likely to be "mama" or "papa".</p>
<p>Somewhat later, /t/ and /d/, formed with the tongue tip against the anterior palate appear. These are followed by the sibilant /s/ and /z/ sounds, which require placing the tongue close to the but not against the palate. The last sound to be acquired is /r/, which requires precise positioning of the posterior borders of the tongue. Often this is not mastered until age 4 or 5.</p>
<p>Since malaligned teeth, and especially mal-related jaws, would make precise tongue positioning difficult, it is surprising that normal speech is acquired by children with severe malocclusion just as it is in those with normal occlusion. If you move the teeth or jaws orthodontically, would that create a risk of speech problems? Fortuately, no--with some minor exceptions that will be discussed in Levels II and III as we take up treatment procedures. </p></pageText><resources/></page></pages></section><section><title>Normal Growth Variations</title><pages><page pageType="content"><title>What is Normal?</title><pageText><p>The brothers shown here are about the same size, but one is 6 years old and the other is 9.

<p>Do you think this represents normal variation?

<p>How could you determine that?

expresses very well the differences in physical growth of a group of children of the same age and 
gender. The important question in examining any child patient is whether differences from the mean 
of the normal curve represent just normal variation, or whether there is an indication of 
abnormality in growth and development.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="281" resourceLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/normalvar.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="78" thumbnailLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/normalvar_s.jpg"><label>Normal distribution for a population</label><caption><p>Knowing where an individual falls on such a distribution can be helpful in determining if they are within the range of normal.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Normal Variation: Birth Length and Weight</title><pageText><p>Do you recognize that this graph of variation in birth length and weight, and subsequent growth, is another version of a normal distribution? If the data were plotted as numbers of children with a given birth length or weight at any specific time, a bell-shaped curve would have been generated. You would get another normal distribution if you took any other point in time. This plot shows you the percentage of children with birth length or weight above or below a certain amount and the percentage distributions at other points in time in early life.</p>
<p>Normal birth weights can range from 2000 grams or about 4 ½ pounds to 4000 grams or nearly 9 pounds. Birth weights outside this range would be considered at least suggestive of abnormality. In fact, it is common today to speak in terms of birth weight instead of prematurity when discussing newborns who are at risk because of their immaturity at birth. But how was that normal range established?</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="260" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/3-14.jpg" thumbnailWidth="46" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/3-14_s.jpg"><label>Growth curve</label><caption><p>This chart is really another version of a normal distribution representing growth just after birth.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>The Limits of Normal Variation</title><pageText><p>The normal range for physical characteristics typically extends from the 3rd to the 97th percentiles, which are outside the colored area of a chart like this, which shows the 5th to the 95th percentiles.</p>
<p>As a general guideline, children above the 97th or below the 3rd percentile are considered possibly abnormal and in need of special investigation. It is possible that these children are simply very small or very large normals, but there is also a significant chance of an abnormality affecting growth. This is true at all stages of growth, from infancy through adolescence.</p>
<p>Note that the percentile lines form channels. A normal child tends to stay in the same channel. In other words, a child who starts out at the 60th percentile tends to stay there during growth. So does a child who starts out at the 20th percentile. A major change in the percentile rank suggests a deviation from the normal growth pattern and a possible abnormality.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="260" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/3-14.jpg" thumbnailWidth="46" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/3-14_s.jpg"><label>Growth curve</label><caption><p>This chart is really another version of a normal distribution representing growth just after birth, but it shows only the 5th to the 95th percentiles--so it doesn't show the potentially abnormal children below the 3rd or above the 97th percentiles. </p></caption></resource></resources></page></pages></section><section><title>Factors Affecting Growth</title><pages><page pageType="content"><title>Important Factors That Influence Growth</title><pageText><p>Let’s look now in more detail at important factors that influence growth. Don’t forget that normal variation should go at the top of the list. In the first program in Level I, we talked about growth charts, particularly where a child is in the distribution and the significance of crossing percentile lines during growth. You might want to look again at that as we go into more detail here.</p>
<p>The second factor to think about now is heredity and genetic traits.   <i><b>﻿delete the list, add heredity here?</b></i></p>
<p>FACTORS INFLUENCING GROWTH</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal variation</li>
<li>Heredity / genetic traits</li>
<li>Changes in body proportions</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Low birth weight</li>
<li>Chronic disease</li>
<li>Psychologic / emotional factors</li>
<li>Nutrition</li>
<li>Ethnic / cultural background</li>
<li>Urban / rural environment</li>
<li>Socio-economic status / family size</li>
<li>Secular trends</li>
</ul></pageText><resources/></page><page pageType="content"><title>Heredity</title><pageText><p>Heredity is an obviously important factor. The boy on the left, the youngest but 
tallest of this group, has the tallest father, and that isn’t coincidence. 
Generally speaking, large children have large parents. It is not uncommon, however, to 
see a small or large child in a family that has a tendency toward the opposite trait.</p>

<p>For all human populations, there is a modest but not perfect correlation between the 
size of the parents and the size of the children. The correlation coefficient (r) is 0.5 
or less. R², the coefficient of determination, expresses the amount of the total 
variation accounted for by the factor being examined. If the correlation between parent 
and child size is 0.5, (0.5)² = 0.25, so heredity explains not more than 25% of the 
variation in size.</p>

<p>The bottom line: heredity is an important factor in determining how tall you are, but 
it's far from the only thing.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="399" resourceLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/8yrolds.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/8yrolds_s.jpg"><label>Boys with different parents</label><caption><p>Heredity accounts for no more that 25% of the variation in growth.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Cephalocaudal Growth Gradient</title><pageText><p>Another factor that must be considered in growth variations is changes in body proportions and changes in tissue systems during growth. Facial proportions, as you know, reflect the cephalocaudal gradient of growth (image 1). That’s another way of saying that generally structures close to the brain grow faster sooner and slower later than those further away.</p>
<p>Have you ever considered that you’re used to looking at differences in facial proportions as you evaluate how old a child is? You might well make the judgment “big for his age” based on that. How do you judge the age of these closely related boys? The difference in facial proportions is one of the things you use automatically in doing that--you have already learned to take that into account when you "size up" children.</p>
<p>Of course, the dentition also provides information about age. Little brother has only primary teeth, big brother has his permanent incisors but nothing beyond that. A dentist has to be able to judge dental age, and we're going to review dental age in detail later in these program--but you already know that dental age does not correlate as well with chronologic age as other biologic ages.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="399" resourceLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/iStock03.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/iStock03_s.jpg"><label>Big brother / little brother</label><caption><p>Note the different facial proportions in the two boys, due to the normal cephalocaudal growth gradient with more growth of the lower than the upper face.</p>
<p/></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Proportions &amp; Systems</title><pageText><p>To a major extent, the changes in body proportions with age reflect different growth rates for different tissue systems. Classically, four major tissue systems are distinguished, and a display like this of their growth pattern is called “Scammon’s curves” after the anthropologist who first published them.</p>
<p>The curves show the early growth of the nervous tissues (and the neurocranium), the tremendous proliferation of lymphoid tissue early in life and its “negative growth” later, and the initially slow and then very rapid growth of sexual tissues. The adolescent growth spurt, and all the things that contribute to that, will be emphasized when we study adolescence in more detail.</p>
<p>You need to be able to draw these curves from memory, so look at them carefully and be sure you understand what is happening during growth of each of the tissue systems.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="412" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/2-2.jpg" thumbnailWidth="73" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/2-2_s.jpg"><label>Scammon’s Curves</label><caption><p>These curves show growth of the neural, genital, and lymphoid tissues in relation to the general somatic growth of the body.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Proportions &amp; Systems (cont.)</title><pageText><p>The change in facial proportions with growth reflects an interaction between the neural and general body growth curves.</p>
<p>As you have already learned in a different context, the growth of the jaws is influenced to some degree by growth of the neurocranium, which  has to grow in about the same way as the brain. We can plot curves for the maxilla and mandible like the ones Scammon plotted, making this relationship clearer and clarifying why you should expect the mandible to be underdeveloped relative to the maxilla in early childhood and why it would catch up later.</p>
<p>As you can see in the figure below, the maxilla almost doesn't show an adolescent growth spure. Although mandibular growth is closer to the general body curve, it too is influenced by growth of the neural structures above. It has an adolescent growth spurt, but not one as intense as the trunk and limbs. Given the gradient of growth, you shouldn't be surprised that the legs grow more than the arms.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="411" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/4-2.jpg" thumbnailWidth="73" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/4-2_s.jpg"><label>Maxilla and mandible added to Scammon's curves</label><caption><p>The curves for the growth of the jaws show that the neural growth curve influences both, with the growth curve for the maxilla closer to the neural curve than the mandible.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Gender</title><pageText><p>Another important factor in growth is gender. That’s more important in adolescence and adulthood than childhood, however. Boys are a little larger than girls at early ages, but at ages between 10 and 12 girls are likely to be larger, and the adult size differential isn’t there until the males have their later and more intense growth spurt.</p>
<p>Note the similar growth velocities for boys and girls up to puberty. In fact, the earlier sexual development in girls means that the tallest child in the 5th or 6th grade is likely to be a female. Boys end up larger because their growth continues longer.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="469" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/4-3.jpg" thumbnailWidth="83" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="preschoolgrowth/images/4-3_s.jpg"><label>Change in height over time</label><caption><p>Note the sharp peaks near puberty – at different times – for boys and girls.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Chronic Disease</title><pageText><p>As you have seen in our earlier discussion of growth charts, chronic illness such as congenital heart disease or an endocrine dysfunction can lead to sustained deficiencies in growth. This usually affects both height and weight, with about the same impact on all tissue systems.</p>
<p>This graph shows the growth of a boy with growth hormone deficiency. Note that he was below the normal range in infancy, and that his lack of growth moved him further from the normal.</p>
<p>But if chronic problems are corrected, catch-up growth usually occurs. Note that when injections of human growth hormone (HGH) began at age 6 (indicated by the up arrow), this boy grew faster than normal, and almost made it to the 3rd percentile at age 14. But when HGH administration was stopped at age 14 (down arrow) growth almost stopped, and when it resumed (up arrow), there was further growth that maintained his position.</p>
<p>Successful repair of a congenital heart defect might have the same effect.

<p>Menarche is a dramatic developmental milestone that tends to get recorded, and so there are particularly good data for this. It’s interesting that there has been a steady decline for at least 150 years in the age of first menstruation in girls. To some extent this probably reflects earlier acquisition of a critical body mass. All other things being equal, sexual maturation in girls and menarche occur when a critical mass of about 46-48 kg (100-105 pounds) is reached. Why the faster growth to that body mass occurs now, however, isn’t totally clear.
