<ul class="spaced"><li>Hyperplasia - an increase in the number of cells</li>
<li>Hypertrophy - an increase in size of the cells</li>
<li>Secretion of extracellular material, which contributes to an increase in size independent of the number or size of the cells themselves.</li>
</ul><p>All three of these phenomena are important in craniofacial growth, including the production of extracellular material that later calcifies into bone.</p></pageText><resources/></page><page pageType="content"><title>Skeletal Growth: Soft Tissues vs. Hard Tissues</title><pageText><p>Calcification of extracellular material leads to a critical distinction between the soft or non-calcified tissues of the body and the hard calcified tissues.</p>
<p>Hard tissues are bones, teeth, and sometimes cartilages. Soft tissues are everything else. Most of the cartilage we will be talking about for craniofacial growth behaves like soft tissue and should be thought of in that way.</p>
<p>Growth of soft tissues occurs mostly by a combination of hyperplasia and hypertrophy. These processes go on within the tissues at all points, and the result is interstitial growth, which simply means growth inside the tissues. Secretion of extracellular material also can accompany interstitial growth, but hyperplasia primarily and hypertrophy secondarily are its characteristics.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/s02_p02_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/s02_p02_01s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>Hyperplasia (primarily) and hypertrophy (secondarily) lead to interstitial growth of soft tissue.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Endochondral Ossification: Interstitial Growth</title><pageText><p>Interstitial growth is shown well in this view of a growing area at the top of the mandibular condyle. This is endochondral ossification, in which cartilage is doing the growing and then is replaced by bone (a process we will review in detail later in this program).</p>
<p>The cartilage is growing by all three of the methods we have described. Hyperplasia, formation of new cells, is occurring in the area below the fibrocartilage that covers the surface of the bone. Below that, note the enormous increase in the size of the maturing cartilage cells. This, of course, is hypertrophy. In addition, the cartilage cells are producing an extracellular material that lies between the cells and separates them. The hypertrophic changes are in preparation for the formation of new bone as it replaces the mature cartilage. Interstitial growth is a characteristic of uncalcified cartilage and other soft tissues.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="431" resourceHeight="448" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/s02_p03_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="77" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/s02_p03_01s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>Endochondral ossification of the mandibular condyle.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Bone Growth: Growth of Hard Tissues</title><pageText><p>In contrast, when calcification takes place so that hard tissue is formed, interstitial growth in the calcified area becomes impossible. Significant growth occurs only at surfaces, not within the calcified mass. The interior of the calcified material can and does remodel, but it can’t grow larger because it’s too hard and rigid to expand internally.</p>
<p>Growth of hard tissue, therefore, occurs in two ways. The first is direct addition to the calcified tissue on its free surfaces. This occurs through the activity of cells in the periosteum, the soft tissue membrane covering the bone. Formation of new cells occurs in the periosteum, and extracellular material is secreted that then calcifies into bone. The second way is by replacement of soft tissue that grew before calcification occurred.</p>
<p>Many bones are modeled in cartilage originally, and the cartilage model is replaced by bone, thus the term “endochondral ossification.” In this situation, the cartilage does the growing while the bone merely replaces it. Cartilage can and does grow interstitally; bone can’t. It’s an attractive intuitive notion that bones expand more or less like a balloon being inflated. In fact, they can’t and don’t grow like that.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/s02_p04_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/s02_p04_01s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Growth of Long Bones: Endochondral Ossification</title><pageText><p>Endochondral ossification of a typical long bone with a cartilaginous precursor begins with bone formation on the surface of the cartilage. This is followed by invasion of blood vessels that produce a hollowed-out center with bone formation in that area (A in the figure).</p>
<p>Ingrowth of blood vessels leads to an ossification center in the cartilaginous caps on either end (B), but a band of cartilage remains between what we can now call the diaphysis (the central part) and epiphyses. These cartilage bands are the epiphyseal plates.</p>
<p>The bone grows longer as the cartilage of the epiphyseal plates grows, matures, and is replaced by bone (C). Eventually, the rate of replacement of the cartilage with bone exceeds the rate of cartilage growth, all the cartilage is replaced—and the bone then is as long as it can get (D).</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="284" resourceHeight="265" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/jmemod2_05nr.jpg" thumbnailWidth="86" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/jmemod2_05nr_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>Endochondral ossification of a long bone.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Bone Growth: Endochondral Ossification (cont.)</title><pageText><p>A histologic view of endochondral ossification at an epiphyseal plate shows the 
areas of proliferating and maturing cartilage, then replacement of degenerating 
mature cartilage by spicules of bone.</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that in addition to the endochondral replacement, 
periosteum is actively forming bone on the outer surfaces. The bone grows longer by 
endochondral ossification. It grows wider by direct formation of new bone on the surface.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="476" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-19a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="85" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-19a_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Bone Growth: Endochondral vs. Surface Ossification</title><pageText><p>The combination of surface apposition of bone and endochondral replacement can be 
seen in this drawing of a growing bone. Periosteal bone formation on the surface is 
different from the endochondral bone formation occurring beneath it.</p>

<p>For endochondral bone formation, a complex maturational pattern of the cartilage 
is required. In direct bone formation by the periosteum, osteoblasts secrete their 
matrix directly in connective tissue, and it calcifies there without any 
intermediate formation of cartilage.</p>

<p>The details of this process are a review of what you learned in histology and will 
not be emphasized further here, but you must understand it.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="386" resourceHeight="256" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/jmemod2_07nr.jpg" thumbnailWidth="121" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/jmemod2_07nr_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Bone Growth: Endochondral vs. Surface Ossification (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Growth at the epiphyseal plate requires corresponding changes in the surface 
of the bone. Not all the surface changes can be met by adding new bone. Because the 
contour of the long bones calls for a knob on the end, a continuous remodeling of 
the surface is required as endochondral growth occurs, meaning that bone must be 
added to the surface in some areas and removed in others.</p>

<p>The periosteum, therefore, must and does contain cells whose purpose is to 
remove bone as well as cells to make it, and there is a balance between apposition 
of bone in some areas and resorption in others. Addition of bone in some areas 
while old bone is removed in others is an essential component of the growth process.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="341" resourceHeight="223" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/jmemod2_08nr.jpg" thumbnailWidth="122" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/jmemod2_08nr_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>Surface remodeling of bone requires resorption (green areas) as well as deposition (yellow areas).</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Bone Growth: Internal Remodeling</title><pageText><p>We have said that growth within a calcified mass is impossible, but that doesn’t 
mean that metabolic change is impossible. In fact, osteocytes embedded in the bone are 
alive, and quite capable of producing internal remodeling of the bone. Calcified tissue 
in bones is turned over through a constant process of remodeling.</p>

<p>In this vital-stained section, you can see the live osteocyte with its processes 
extending out into the calcified bone around it. This makes it obvious how activity by 
a cell like this can affect calcified tissue at a distance from the cell body of the 
osteocyte.</p>

<p>Remodeling of the internal structure of bone has two major functions: it serves as a 
means of adapting the bone to mechanical stresses, and it also makes calcium and 
phosphate ions available for exchange with blood. Exchange of calcium and phosphate 
occurs near periosteal surfaces and around Haversian systems.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="400" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/scrn15.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/scrn15_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Bone Growth: Internal Remodeling (cont.)</title><pageText><p>In this decalcifed section from a bone, the larger holes are where a blood vessel was, the smaller lacunae are where the cells were. Osteocytes cluster around vascular channels, as you can see. Ingrowth of blood vessels into an area of cartilage or connective tissue is essential for ossification. It also is essential for maintenance of the calcified tissue.</p>
<p>A complex like the one shown here, with osteocytes surrounding a blood vessel, is called a Haversian system, and it’s constantly remodeled during life. This internal remodeling, however, does not significantly contribute to growth or change the shape of the bone. The bone can’t get bigger through internal remodeling.</p>
<p>In this section of bone, you can see remnants of an old Haversian system (dotted yellow lines) being replaced by a smaller new one as the bone remodels. Bone is a dynamic tissue, constantly being rebuilt. It’s a mistake to think of it as just an inert scaffold on which the other tissues are suspended.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="296" resourceHeight="366" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/s02_p10_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="65" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/s02_p10_01s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page></pages></section><section><title>Cranial and Maxillary Growth</title><pages><page pageType="content"><title>Regions of the Cranium and Face</title><pageText><p>With the general principles of bone growth established, let’s look in more detail at growth of the cranium and face. For this discussion, it will be convenient to divide the cranium and face into two areas each:</p>
<p>For the cranium (labeled 1 in this image):<br/> The <b><i>cranial vault</i></b> and <b><i>cranial base</i></b>.</p>
<p>For the face: The <b><i>naso-maxillary complex</i></b> (2) and<br/> the <b><i>mandible </i></b>(3).</p>
<p>The special features of growth of the dentoalveolar processes (4, 5) and eruption of the teeth will be considered later.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="417" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/6-41.jpg" thumbnailWidth="74" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/6-41_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Skeletal Growth: Cranial Vault</title><pageText><p>Let’s begin by examining the cranial vault. It is made up of a number of 
flat bones that are formed directly by periosteum. Endochondral bone formation has 
no role here, and there’s never any cartilage in the vicinity. Instead, growth 
occurs entirely by periosteal activity at the surfaces of the bones, both at the flat 
inner and outer surfaces and the periosteum-lined spaces between them.</p>

<p>At birth, the bones are rather widely separated by connective tissues, and these 
open spaces are called fontanelles. The presence of the fontanelles allows considerable 
deformation at birth, which is important in getting the relatively large head through 
the birth canal.</p>

<p>Apposition of bone along the edges of the fontanelles eliminates these open spaces 
fairly quickly after birth, but the bones remain separated by thin periosteum-lined 
sutures for years.</p>

<p>Despite their small size, apposition of bone at the sutures is the major mechanism 
for growth of the cranial vault. In addition, there is a tendency for bone to be 
removed from the inner surface of each bone and added to the outer surface, especially 
in some areas where contours change. The magnitude of the remodeling changes, however, 
is much less than the growth at sutures.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="363" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-23.jpg" thumbnailWidth="132" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-23_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>Fontanelles of the newborn skull.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Skeletal Growth: Cranial Base</title><pageText><p>In contrast to the cranial vault, the bones of the cranial base (particularly in the midline) are formed initially in cartilage, then transformed into bone. At about 8 weeks in utero (image A), before any bone formation has begun, an essentially solid bar of cartilage extends beneath the brain from the nasal capsule anteriorly to the occipital area posteriorly. This cartilage is called the chondocranium.</p>
<p>At 12 weeks (image B), ossification centers have appeared in the midline cartilage structures. In addition, intramembranous bone formation has begun in the cranial vault (B in the Figure). From this point on, bone (dark blue color) replaces the original chondrocranium rapidly, but remnants of it persist as small cartilaginous synchondroses and remain between the developing occipital, sphenoid and ethmoid bones.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="281" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-18ab.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="78" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-18ab_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Skeletal Growth: Cranial Base (cont.)</title><pageText><p>It should come as no surprise that the lengthening of the cranial base is largely due to endochondral replacement. As one moves laterally beneath the brain, growth at sutures and surface remodeling become more important, but the cranial base is essentially a midline structure, and the synchondroses are important growth sites. The most important ones are the spheno-occiptal, inter-sphenoid and spheno-ethmoidal synchondroses.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="399" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-24.jpg" thumbnailWidth="120" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-24_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>Major synchondroses of the cranial base.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Synchondrosis vs. Suture</title><pageText><p>Be sure you understand the difference between a suture and a synchondrosis. Both are thin soft tissue areas between adjacent bones, but the synchondrosis is filled with cartilage. A band of proliferating cartilage cells is located in the center of the synchondrosis, and a band of maturing cartilage extends in both directions away from the center. Endochondral ossification occurs at both margins.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="329" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-25ab.jpg" thumbnailWidth="146" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-25ab_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>A: distant view of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, where growth pushes the sphenoid bone away from the occipital bone.

At the synchondrosis, bone formation proceeds by cartilage replacement, while for sutures, there is no intermediate cartilage stage.</p>
<p>As you will see when we review growth control, the difference is significant: the cartilage at synchondroses is capable of active, independent growth while the connective tissue at sutures only reacts to what happens in its surroundings.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/s03_p06_01.jpg" thumbnailWidth="107" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/s03_p06_01s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Skeletal Growth: Maxilla</title><pageText><p>Now let’s consider the maxilla and the associated smaller nasal and palatine bones. Postnatally, the face grows downward and forward from the cranium, and the maxilla must move a considerable distance. How this occurs, and what changes accompany the growth, are what we must focus on now. In the case of the maxilla, there is no pre-existing cartilage, so maxillary growth is a matter of sutures and surface remodeling.</p>
<p>In contrast to the cranial vault, however, surface remodeling changes are quite dramatic and important. In addition, as this figure shows, the naso-maxillary complex is affected indirectly by the endochondral growth of the cranial base, which pushes the maxilla forward and thereby contributes to its forward translation. How long would this mechanism of growth be effective? Only as long as the cranial base is growing--and that ends at about the time brain growth ends, at about age 6.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="378" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/4-7.jpg" thumbnailWidth="67" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/4-7_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Skeletal Growth: Maxilla (cont.)</title><pageText><p>Let’s look in more detail at the right half of the maxilla in this figure. Note that it forms the floor of the orbit, the lateral wall of the nose, the roof of the mouth and the lateral aspects of the facial skeleton. There are sutures posteriorly along the maxillary tuberosity, superiorly at the end of the frontal process, and superiorly-laterally along the zygomatic process.</p>
<p>There’s also a suture in the midline down the middle of the palate, providing a mechanism for the midface and upper dental arch to become wider. Growth occurs by apposition at the sutures and by remodeling of the surfaces.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="404" resourceHeight="349" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/jmemod2_10nr.jpg" thumbnailWidth="93" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/jmemod2_10nr_s.jpg"><label/><caption/></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Growth at Sutures and Surfaces of the Maxilla</title><pageText><p>It is apparent that the posterior and superior sutures of the maxilla are ideally situated to allow downward and forward repositioning. As the maxilla moves in that direction, new bone is added at the sutures to maintain its connection to the cranium.</p>
<p>The space that would otherwise open up at the sutures is filled in by proliferation of bone, so the sutures remain the same width but the various processes of the maxilla become longer. As the drawing illustrates, this requires moving the maxilla away from the structures above and behind it.</p>
<p>Part of the posterior border of the maxilla, in the tuberosity area, is a free surface. Bone is added to this area, creating additional space into which the molar teeth can erupt.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="543" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-26.jpg" thumbnailWidth="97" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-26_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>Apposition of bone at the sutures surrounding the maxilla as it grows down and forward.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Surface Resorption in Growth of Maxilla</title><pageText><p>As the maxilla grows down and forward, its front surfaces are remodeled, and bone is actually removed from most of the anterior surface.</p>

Note that almost the whole anterior surface is a resorptive area–which seems backward to what you might think it should be.

The difference begins with its relationship to the chondro-cranium. The mandible has a cartilage model, of sorts (Meckel's cartilage, a cartilaginous bar in the mandibular arch whose proximal ends eventually ossify to form the malleus of the middle ear). But the mandible develops more in association with that cartilage than by replacing it.</p>
<p>Bone formation begins just lateral to Meckel’s cartilage and spreads posteriorly along it without any direct replacement of the cartilage by the newly forming bone.The two halves fuse very early, so for all practical purposes, a growing mandible, even in fetal life, is a single bone extending across the midline.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="263" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-21.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="73" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-21_s.jpg"><label/><caption><p>Mandibular bone forming in relation to Meckel’s cartilage.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Origin and Growth of the Condylar Cartilage</title><pageText><p>There is some cartilage that covers the surface of the condyle at the temporomandibular (TM) joint, but it appears relatively late in embryonic life and is not derived from Meckel’s cartilage.

<p>If you hold the cranium constant and look at mandibular growth relative to it (A), the chin moves downward and forward a long way relative to the cranium, so you might think that new bone was added anteriorly. But, if you look specifically at the sites of growth on the bone as revealed by vital staining and similar techniques, very little change occurs at the chin and most of the growth is posteriorly (B). Superimposing on the chin correctly shows that the body of the mandible grows longer by apposition of bone on the posterior surface, and the ramus grows higher by endochondral replacement at the condyle and by surface remodeling.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="600" resourceHeight="176" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-30ab.jpg" thumbnailWidth="166" thumbnailHeight="49" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/2-30ab_s.jpg"><label>The pattern of mandibular growth from two viewpoints</label><caption><p>The mandible appears to grown downward and forward, away from the cranial base (A).

<p>If the x-ray tracings are superimposed at the chin so that the anterior mandible is held constant, then it appears that the mandible grows upward and backward (Image 2).

In both jaws, growth of the bone that supports the teeth is an important aspect of the overall growth process.</p>
<p>One way to think about it is that the mandible grows downward away from the maxilla, creating more space between the jaws. As the jaws grow, the teeth are actively erupting (they have to in order to maintain contact), and as they erupt they bring alveolar bone with them, so that the alveolar processes become taller. Note in this cephalometric superimposition how the teeth erupted to compensate for greater downward movement of the mandible than the maxilla. If new alveolar bone didn’t form, the teeth would just grow right out of the bone. We’ll be looking more at what happens to the teeth during growth in the later part of this course.</p></pageText><resources><resource resourceType="image" resourceWidth="337" resourceHeight="450" resourceLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/4-9a.jpg" thumbnailWidth="60" thumbnailHeight="80" thumbnailLocation="naturecfgrowth/images/4-9a_s.jpg"><label>Superimposition of a growing patient, registered on the cranial base</label><caption><p>As the maxilla and mandible move downward in relation to the cranial base, the teeth erupt and bring alveolar bone with them.</p></caption></resource></resources></page><page pageType="content"><title>Summary</title><pageText><p>To summarize the important points:</p>
<p>First, you certainly should understand that bone cannot grow interstitially, and the growth of the facial skeleton cannot be explained in that way. Where interstitial growth is important for the skeleton, a layer of cartilage in that area does the growing, and then bone replaces it.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the sites and types of growth in the cranium and cranial base:</p>
<ul class="spaced"><li>Growth of the cranium occurs largely at the sutures, with a little surface remodeling;</li>
<li>The cranial base grows largely by endochondral replacement at the mid-line synchondroses, but also by apposition at sutures laterally;</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, with regard to the sites and types of growth in the jaws and face:</p>
<ul class="spaced"><li>Growth of the maxilla and associated structures is a combination of growth at sutures and surface remodeling. As the maxilla is translated downward and forward during growth, bone fills in at the superior and posterior sutures and is added at the tuberosity;</li>
<li>The mandible grows largely by apposition and remodeling resorption of the ramus, and by endochondral replacement at the condyles;</li>
<li>The alveolar processes of both jaws grow as the teeth erupt, bring bone with them.</li>
